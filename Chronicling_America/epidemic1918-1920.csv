that a reply shall be made to the tier

Rime in Russia, it will be difficult for
the Bolaffevlki to convey the invita
tion for a peace discussion, but it is
regarded as entirely possible that the
German government might request the
Swiss foreign office to transmit an In
vitation.
General staff officers here are un
derstood to attach great significance
to the presegtattempt of the Central
Powers to ftrce the Kntente Powers
into peace negotiations. To their mind,
it is a clear indication that tne Ger
man military leaders have now accom
plished all that they feel capable of
doing in the held. They can “hold
on"" for a long time yet, it is sug
gested. but they cannot extend fields
of occupation without an enormous
loss of men and time at the risk of a
terrible defeat. Therefore, the Teu
ton diplomatists seek to realize every
thing possible from what the German
armies have done and the Brest-U
tovsk conference is the first s;ep to
ward that end.

with less than half the city's normal’
supply of coal coming into its bins. i
.SevernI deaths due to the cold were,

STROUDWATER GRANGE
HALL BURNED MONDAY
Portland, Me.. Dec. 31.—Fire which
broke out early Monday morning com
pletely gutted the handsome two-story
and a half grange hall of the Stroud
water grai.ge, and threatened for a
time to wipe out the entire lower sec
tion of the village.
The fact that the roofs of tl^e adjoin
ing buildings were covered with snow,
with the hard work of Chief Butler
and his men, was all that prevented
the flames from spreading to the
blacksmith shop of James \V. Lyons,
the grocery and hardware store of
Andrew Hawes, and the building in
which is located Quiraby hall.
This makes the second time in two
days that the hall has been on jlre
as Officer DeWolfe and several mem
bers of tl.e grange put out a blaze
that started around the large open
fireplace rf the hall Saturday night,
and it is believed that the fire whwsh
destroyed the building this mordlug
caught in the same place.
The loss .o the building and contents
will amount to several thousands of
dollars.
The Stroud water Grange hall was
built about ttvo years ago and «’<ts
modern in every particular. The
building was of historic interest, as
if was built from tlie Umbers of th$
old tide mill, which was located on
i the Stroudwater river, across lh<y
street from the site of the building that
was burned.

Clemenceau’s Stand Decided
i -M. Clemenceau, the French Premier,
lias no intention to permit the Rus
sian Socialists to gain an erroneous
idea as to the stand of France in the
war. He therefore lias refused to sanc
tion the granting of passports to Pe

sire to visit the Russian capital, de
claring the situation there gs too cha

CROZIER PLEDGES
(Continued from Page One)
afterward.
A in o ns; other things Gen. Crozier tol.l
ilie committee that the government al
ready was building a pow'tte* fac tory that
would have a dally capacity of a million
liotinds. lie denied stoiSjs that wooden
guns had been furnished to men .11 „ne
cantonments, explaining that w.ljat had
been taken for guns were sticks for bay
onet practice.
Senator Hitchcock asked why Lewis
guns were not used tmk^the Brownings
were ready, and Gen. lazier said Gen.
Pershing wanted ihe Vickers for ground
work and had made tut ‘‘unprecedented""
demand for Lewis guns for aeriai -vom
lit conferences with the war college and
other heads it was decided to use Lewis
guns exclusively tor the aviation service
and the Hotchkiss and French guns for
ground work until the Brownings arc
ready.
Answering questions r e g a r d i n g
equipment at camps in this country.
Gen. Crozier said:
I think the regular nvrny and na
tional guard will ite completely equip
ped witli Springfield lilies within a
month, unless new organisations are
unexpectedly created.""
The National Army, he continued,
will use Enfield rifles.
‘‘Within a fortnight there will be
enough made. "" he said, ""but I don’t
know how long it will take to get them !
to camp. Their manufacture will be
completed in another week. If the rail- '
roads will do what they ought to do(
we ought to have a complete supply1
delivered in the camps by Feb. 1. 1
Senator MeKellar asked when all ,
forces can be fully equipped with'ma- i
chine guns.
Gen. Crozier said he believed lie ;
could equip the proposed new draft of
500.000 men with rifles in two months. :
Crozier Put Under Oath
Before beginning General Crozier
asked to he put under oath and then■
road a prepared statement dealing
first with borrowing artillery from the
Allies for General Pershing’s forces.
Desire to make America’s forces* of!
actual aid on the fighting front as
soon as possible was a prime factor,
General yrozier said, in the artillery
loans from France. Correspondence
was produced in which M. Tardieu, of
the French high conmfission. asked the
War department to order French ar
tillery. Conferences between repre
sentatives of the British. French and
American governments abroad, regard
ing furnishing ot artillery to America’s
(forces were recited by General Crozier.
He produced a letter from General
Bliss, ehiei of staff, stating that Brit
ish and French munitions heads had
formally assured him that their artil
lery and ammunition production had
so increased that they would be able
to completely equip all American for
ces arriving abroad in I»18.
How he had. during previous years,
often asked Congress for larger ap
propriations for artillery and that he
and other army heads had many times
called the country’s attention to the
need for more artillery, was related
by the general.
Machine guns. General Crozier said, j
were never expected to become such
an important weapon, but the Ger
mans. realizing better than anyone else
their great future, proceeded to secure
them in quantities.
Official Records of Department
i liming to the charges that prej
dice had kept the Lewis gun out
American equipment. General Croz
detailed the official records of the c
partrrfent.
The first offer, to his knowled,
was ueceived May 2. 1912, w„en j
Automatic Arms Co. asked for a sp<
iul te*. The correspondence shov
t fir ’
r tJIt
that
ul«r
ordnance board offered a
t with ammunition furnis
by the government. Xo test follov
but-on .March 5. »13, another Lc
gun was offered for a test, which
he(d at the Springfield arsenal.
; '[it ■ :
Vickers was adopted, however, be
cause the board's report showed the
Lewis gun jarrtrned LOG times, had 33;
Parts broken and 15 parts required re
Placement, while the Vickers gun '
jammed only 23 times and had no parts '
broken. The board held the Lewis ghn
interior to the Vickers or Bennett-Mer
cier. w
Xo other Lewis gun, General Crozier
said, was submitted for a test until
April 1916. The war department pre
viously asked for a Lewis gun, to test j
but the Savage Arms Co. stated none
was available. Ir> the tests of April
1916. General Crozier said, the manu
facturers withdrew the guns because
it was . id they were not in condition.
In the summer of 1916, General Crozier
said, on his own initiative and without
having been appropriated, he bought
350 Lewis guns for use with British
ammunition on the Mexican border,
letters from officers having charge of
the guns Criticizing the Lewis gun ad
versely were produced, and General
Crozier said that in the border serv
ice the Lewis gun was generally prov
ed inferior.
A report last January from the army
school of musketry saying that the
Lewis gun ""as at present developed is
not a satisfactory arm” also was pro
duced by General Crozier.
Early Appropriations Meager
Congressional appropriations for ma
chine guns prior to 1916, when 312,000,000
was authorized. Gen. Crozier said, had
been very meagre. Because of machine
gun development and the large 1916 ap
propriation. General Crozier said, Sec
retary Baker decided to appoint a spe
cial board, organized in September,
1916, which arranged for the tests of
May. 1917. It was evident, he said, that
good Lewis guns were being made in
England for use with British ammuni
tion and poor Lewis guns were being
made in this country.
When war with Germany became im
minent. General Crozier said, lie asked
for 5000 Lewis guns. On April 12, he
said. 1300 Lewis guns were ordered,
lMC0 more on June 12, and 2000 more
June 16.
""This show.-."" said General Crozier,
""that as soon as the Lewis gun was de
veloped for use with American ammu
nition large orders were immediately
given.
""There is good prospect that our
forces in Aurope will not lie lacking
guns in any way.” he added.
Seventy-five hundred machine guns
are available for training purposes in
this odlintry Genera 1 Crozier said
Tul'nthg to the charges by Colonel
Lewis, inventor of the gun bearing bis
name, that General Crozier had been
prejudiced against him. General Crozier
sliowej. that a board which investigated
charge's exonerated him. Assertions
that he had opposed adoption of Col
onel Lewis' range finder, also were cat
eeori.cally denied by General Crozier.
To criticisms that the war department
delayed rifle production by modifying the
British Enfield so that is could he used
with Atpcrlc tn ammunition. General e_.ro
xUfrfrlenied that standards fixed for in
lefljnangeabUity of parts caused any se
rious delay,
BegalWng charges that there were rifle
and machine gun shortages in training
camps. General Crozier declared:
“Enough rifles have been manufactured
to equip all the troops 'in the canton
ments, but i Cj not knpw if they have
actually arrive J.""
Brownir^ Gun Agreement
Genera! Croze, was asked if reports are
true that tile go eminent has agreed to
appropriate $12.259,'too for patent rights to
the new Browning gun and explained that
the government had agreed to pay n.t less
tii.m $2,290,000 in advance of its manufac-k
11 -e. T:i reply to Senator Frtslinghuysen,
General Crosier said that it was not in
tended to ordtr any more Kenet-Jle'rcier
guns. “Prom every report and recom
mendation until the spring of 1916, when
the Lewis gun was improved.” said Gon.
Crozier, ""there »■«-, absolutely no justifl
cation for investing one cent of money in
Lewis guns. When it was improved Its
investigation was immediately begun.
TAX DODGERS DISLOYAL
AS WELL AS DISHONEST
New York. Dec. 21.—Citizens who
seek to e vade payment of taxes in time
of war are slackers and are rot only
dishonest, hut disloyal, declared Dan
iel C. Roper, commissioner of Internal
revenue, who came here from Washing
ton today to address several hundred
internal revenue employes in ihis dis
trict.
“Every dollar that is withheld from
the public treasury weakens our
chances,"" he said, ""ft should be our
purpose, as it is our duty, to see that
(very dollar one the government under
the law is paid. In your work you will
find the slacker, the man who seeks to
evade the payment of the tax which
his representatives jr, Congress have
formally and with full authority de
clared to be his just share of the war
burden. The attitude of such a man is
pitiable. Not only is he dishonest, he is
disloyal. He fully deserves to be a man
without a country. He j;i not entitled
to the “lightest consideration and will
receive none. The government expects
of you that you will bring the slackers
into camp to do thejr service and suf
fer their penalties by compulsion.""

today to consider plans for carrying
out additional consolidation of serv

Director General McAdoo and the j
railroad war board. The details of I
these plans will be announced as j
rapidly as they can be developed.
The most important matter taken I
up was the /order for disregarding !
routing by shippers when speed and ‘
transportation efficiency are involv-j
cd. The traffic officers of .the roads j
were instructed to work out this plan •
so as to inconvenience shippers as lit- ;

with measures to prevent food queues; j
the new powers of food committees,
registration of customers, registra
tion of retailers, rationing of manu
facturers, caterers and institutions
and local voluntary derangements for
adjusting supplies. \ppended is a
; model ration card.
To prevent food lines, Lord It hound -
da says that every customer should be
registered at one shop, anJ not al
lowed 10 deal elsewhere. ’ Shop keep
ers should be required to divide sup
plies in fair proportion among the
registered customers and no shop
keepers should be allowed to register
more customers than he can conven

34 BELOW AT BATH !
Fear Ice Jam in Kenne
bec May Suspend
Navigation
Bath, Me., Dec. 31.—Sunday morn
ing was the coldest ever known in
Bath, the mercury dropping: to 34 be
low in many places while 30 bel<^w
waa not at all uncommon. Reports
from Kast Brunswick varied from 35 i
to 40 below. At < this morning ther
mometers registered 10 degrees warm
er than at the same hour Sunday.
People living in the vicinity of
Ham's Hill reported 35 below Sunday
morning, while at the home of John:
T. Parris, upper Washington street, 34 '
below was reported and 24 this morn- I
lng. N. F. Howe. Arrowslc, reported
28 yesterday and 19 below today. Wil
bur Howe, who lives near Chapps
Point, Woolwich, reported 28 below
yesterday and 19 below today. In
West Bath, Thomas F. Perkins report
ed 30 below and Joseph Lemont 32 be
low while the average today was 24
below. Edward H. Pierce of the
Doubling Point light reported 24 be
low yesterday and only 12 today.
The formation of ice in the Kenne
bec river Sunday was such as to cause
deep concern for those interested in
navigation. The river was frozen
solidly across as far down as the j
plant of th^ Texas Steamship Co., ;
but the little ferry Hocfcomock by
her frequent trips kept an open track
from dock to dock. Below this there
was another solid field as far down
as Fiddler's Reach.
During the early afternoon Agent
L. K. Thebvau of the Maine Central j
decided that the situation was becom- i
ing critical if uninterrupted train j
schedules were to be kept up today!
so ordered the big transfer ferry Fer- !
dinando Gorges to go out and break j
up the ice. which she did with ease. '
Starting out front the Bath dock she i
went directly to the Woolwich dock •
and then returned, first going down the j
river nearly to the reach and then up. j
This released big fields of ice which J
made a clear ttack for the boat today, i
The Hockomock has not fared soj
well today, however, as she did yes- |
terday. for much of the drift Ice was !
blown into the Woolwich dock, where |
it had lodged, one cake slipping un- !
der another until at "" this morning ice i
two feet thick was reported. It was1
impossible for the little boat to get.!
into hei own dock and so she went,
into the dock of the Maine Central, !
where workmen employed in Bath i
shipyards and shops were taken aboard I
and brought across. Efforts have been !
made all day to break up the ice and I
release it front the dock.
Much of the drift Ice was carried down ;
the- river on the ebb tide to the reach, '
where it lodged during the afternoon and
night and steamboat' men"" were appre-1
hensive that Ruch a jam would take place 1
that navigation would be tied up. Owing
to the fact that more coal is expected to
arrive in Bath by water soon and that in .
order that there may be no suffering 1t;
is absolutely important that there be m»
tleup in navigation, even temporarily,
Oliver Moses, chairman of the local fuel
commission, immediately took up the
matter with James C. Hamlen. Portland.;
federal fuel administrator, while Hon. ‘
Edward W. Hyde, president of the Cham-;
her of Commerce, got in touch witn Capt.;
William It. Hush, commandant of the
tirst naval district at the Charleston-:-,
navy yard.
Both gentlemen were assured that ev- :
erything possible would l*e done to relieve
the situation, and it is expected that rev
enue cutters or lighthouse tender* will be !
sent over to break up the ice from the
lower end of the reach that H may drift
down on the eni, tide. As it is. the small
jam is gro«;r.g suffer and stiffer and it is
feared that unless *onte move is made at
once, navigation, will he stopped.

AUGUSTA LOCALS
“CHEER UP!” IS A «
GREAT SUCCESS
MONDAY EVENING
City Hall Is Well Pilled
and All Enjoy a Fine
Vaudeville Program—
Solo Dances by Little
Miss Louise Brown of
Boston Feature the
Affair
In right royal fashion was the New
Year welcomed to Augusta, when the.
society folk of the Capital City and a
half dozen adjoining towns gathered
for the “Cheer Up"" at City hall, wit
nessed a program of most exceptional
vaudeville and danced and sang the
old year out, the New Year in. netting
thereby a handsome sum for Red Cross
work.
It was an affair worthy of the city
and a credit to the ladies' committee
which lias done so much to furnish
Augusta with novel and pleasing char
ity halls and to swell the great sums
that are each year placed to the cred
it of local charity organizations.
The committee on decorations fairly
outdid themselves in transforming the
hall which so readily lends itself to
artistic effects. There were heavy
hanks of fir boughs and fir trees around
the hall, on the balcony railing and on
the stage, lightened with festoons of
pink and touches of cotton anu ""dia
mond dust"" in realistic simulation of
snow Arranged in a rectangle around
the dancing floor were 68 tables, cover
ed with snowy linen and decorated
each with a candalabrum Around these
tables wore seated the dancers and at
them, in the intermission, refreshments
were served by girls of the Cony high
school.
Interspersed with the hall room
dances were four fancy dancing num
bers of the highest type and one panto
mime in which Augusta's best ama
teurs furnished a few minutes of riot
ous amusement, with such realistic
characterizations of the spectators at a
rural movie that they convulsed the
audience with gales of merriment.
The first of the fancy dances was T.e
Carnival, and the solo dancing. T.e i l’e
tites Galllardes, In which Dorothy Hill,
Joan and Mary Sturtevant, Ruth Hazel
Wood, Anna I-Iendee. Ruth Petting!!!,
Eleanor Nelson and Dorothy Stone, with
Virginia Odlome and Tiwne Goodrich in
the solo parts, won round after round
of well-deserved applause. Dressed in
charming white costumes they made a
pretty picture against the green back
ground and their dancing was absolute
ly professional in its excellence and re
flected high credit on Mrs. Odlorne and
Miss Gertrude Moore, who trained them.
wuuibo crown a oxar
The dancing of tiny Rouise Brown, the
dainty little Boston dancer, would have
been a feature of any bill. Her opening
numl.er was a military dance, the steps
and arrangement virtually her own, amt
her costume a most bewitching modifica
tion of the Cossack garb. This was fol
lowed by an exposition ot what is re
garded among professionals as the high
est expression of the art of dancing, tbs
ballet or toe'dance, at which she excels.
In this dance she was instructed lty the
St eat master, Alexis Kosloff. for many
years with the Imperial Ballet of Russia
and by Marie Ware Raw ton in the famous
school of the Outdoor Players at lvtet^
boro, X H.. and she proved n credit to
her great teachers. Her closing number
was another of her gualnt improvisations,
an eccentric dance, which she terms ' The
Hag”—a comedy and acrobatic dam-.- in
which she excelled. Rittle Bonis- proved
graceful and pretty and won hearty ap
plause and an insistent encore for each
da nee.
The sole comedy number. ""A Coun
try Movie,"" proved a success bevond ’
the fondest hopes of Director Wm. O.
Bunker and his talented company. To
name tlie stars is to name the entire
list: Mi. Bunker, R. H. Bodwell, Hen

“Hoch Der Kaiser""
The following is the famous poem recit
el by Capta'iu t’oghlan of the United
s’lales warrJnp Kuleigii at a banquet i
New Y.irk during the Spanish war. widen
created such a pale of laughter the
country over and for which the captain
was reprimanded in orders by the navy
department, but a reprimand which every
one understood. The poem is said to have
been written by Rodney Blake:

'’luu les I. Hamden, one of the so- .
i< na il of Rangrlry. and for twenty
y.iu a dealer in raw furs, showed the
editor of the Farmington Chronicle a
Idacl. fox skin Friday, which lie says is
lin best of all the similar skins he
has ever handled. An offer of $5'""i had
•already been made for the skin, which
is a very large one. hut Mr. Hamden
said some of the dealers in the larger
cities were going to see the skin before
ft was sold. The fox was caught by
\ letor Bachelder and Hob- rt Campbell
of Rangeley.
It is a common remark among at-;
torneys, says the liidileford Journal.;
that a single session of tlie supreme'
eourt in York county each year would
lake care of all the litigation that
comes to trial in these days, and save
the county, which is the people, a lot
of money. It might he well to have two
criminal sessions a year, but these
would be short.
The mysterious airplane—or some t
other—which was watched night after
night during the fall by people living
in the Elm street section above Mason
street has again made its appearance,
reports the Biddeford Record. On three !
successive evenings recently the 'plane j
1 has been seen by residents of Beacon I
avenue and other streets in that local- i
ity and has been watched for an hour ,
or more on each evening.
The fix e^ has made its appearance
t
about 7 o'clock each evening, coming
from the tve.-i am! sailing at a high alti
tude. That i: was an airplane none
of those who saw it have the slightest
doubt. It showed a red light at one
end and a green one*at the othei and
seemed to be moving very rapidly. At
no time did it appeal to be stationary,
but after reaching a point apparently
a short distance beyond the V.’ebber
hospital it turned sharply and went
off in the direction of Sanford. At times
the machine would descend to a consid
erable distance and then rise again.
There is a good deal o? curiosity
manifested among people up Elm street
way to know what this ’plane is. where
it comes from night after night and
where it goes to.
I'nable to buy, beg or borrow fuel
with which to heat his home, W. W.
Welch, American express messenger at
Houlton, has telephoned to the Bangor
headquarters cf his company for a
leave of absence so that he can go into
the woods and “cut a cord” to keep
his family from shivering to death, says
the Commercial. Mr. Welch was
granted perms sion io lay off for a few
days, and lost no time in taking his axe
and starting for the tall timbers.
When he could not buy coal, he tried
to buy wood, and when he found that
wood was unobtainable, he tried to hire
someone to cut it. Failing in this, he
is now in the wood lot getting out his
own fuel. Will this lie a general prac
tice here in Maine before long.'
The Sheepsct river, for the first
! time m y* ars. i.t frozen over and the
' little mail steamer Winter Harbor was
on Friday tumble to carry the mail
from Bod obey Harbor to Wiscasset.
The steamer Virginia was unable to
make the passage from I’opham to
Bath on Fridas morning, owing to the
ice in Fiddlers Bc-ach. below Bath and
the management stilt* d that no further
attempts would be made until the Ken

in ""getting on""1' on his ft lends, en

A serious accident wns narrowly es
caped on Friday when a freight train

tire of one of the locomotive wh-els
came off just as it was running over

SOCIALISM.
Socialism exhibits a beautiful picture
when we view it in the light thrown on
it by an idealistic philosopher whose
■mind is overflowing with love for his
fellowman and a great desire to make
his life happier and better. When this
picture is seen through the lenses of the
experience which time has vouchsafed,
its beauty vanishes. Its shadows are too
dark. Its surface bloodstained. That
many honest men and good citizens are
socialists is certainly true, but when
these men make a stand for what they
believe, many of the idle and nearly ail
the vicious and the criminal gather about
their standard. This has had many an
illustration and doubtless will have many
more. Therefore, the honest, well mean
ing socialist bides his time, hoping al
most without faith, that this incubus
which rests upon socialism may some
how be lifted. While these men have
waited and hoped, agitators and knaves
have seized every opportunity to disor
ganize the industry of the country, and
even the government itself. Their aim
is not to make the world better but to
arrogate power to themselves and to add
pelf to their purses. William l). Hay
wood of the I. W. W. is one of these.
This association of which Haywood is
one of the leaders would heartily join
socialism in an effort to destroy the ex
isting government, and, if that were suc
cessful, would as heartily assist in a
movement to destroy socialism and to
replace it with communism or even with
anarchy. Evolution is one of the roads
which leads to betterment. Retrogres
sion is a direct highway leading to the
region of lower types. Unscrupulous
men have succeeded in leading socialism
in the wrong direction. Its dominant
type now is Lenine and Trotzky, advent
urers in whom the ego towers high above
■honor, making war upon their country
men whileshouting for world peace. Tney
ha ve condescended to bank robbery and
repudiation of honest debts, striving to
make peace with the German autocracy
which within a third of a year has robbed
their country of several valuable prov
inces. Not content with that they are
endeavoring to extend their propoganda j
even into the United States. Just at
present they can make bu^ little head
way But after the war has been over a !
few months and the thousands of people j
now employed in special war work are
seeking new avocations; when business1
itself will be unsettled; when readjust- j
iment comes with falling wages and prices j
■still inflated because of scarcity; then1
'JUsoontent will give the Haywoods, the j
Lenines and the Trotzkys their oppor
tunity for disorganization. Then social
ism in its debased ambitions may become |
a serious menace even here. This coun
try of ours has cost and is now costing
too many lives and too much money and
•suffering to be given over to be wrecked
ttry the plots of irresponsible men. Social
iram .must purify itself or eventually it
■must be sppresaed.
RAILROAD CONTROL.
Mr. McAdoo, Treasurer of the United
States, Director-general of the railroads,
etc., is currently reported to have said
that there are some six hundred small
lines which are not to be taken,over by
■the government. We wonder if the little
road in which Belfast is so vitally inter
ested is one of the six hundred which is
to ride “into the valley of death” as did
that other six hundred whose valor has
been immortalized in verse. If only the
main lines are to be taken and the
branches and little independent lines are
to be left to manage for themselves as
best they can, few of them will pass
through the valley alive. We hope if
the Maine Central is taken that our
branch will be considered as a part of
that system. We shall then get some
part of the $945,000,000 which the gov
ernment is to allot to the roads. We al
so hope that the Maine Central and the
Bangor and Aroostook will be left to
manage their own affairs because we be
lieve the managers of these roads know
infinitely more about the railroad busi
ness than does Mr. McAdoo, and will
better conserve their own interests and
the interests of the people whom they
serve. Anything which cripples or de
stroys the small roads which are so es
sential to local communities and as feed
ers to the trunk lines, will cripple, if it
does not destroy businesses which have
added much to the prosperity of the
country.
Until the lease of our road to the Maine
Central expires we shall probably not be
injured by governmental control, but if
governmental control is to continue after
that and for an indefinite period our in
terests may suffer. We have therefore
more than a passing concern in the en
actment of a bill which shall terminate
government control of railroads at the
close of the war. The President did not
take over the railroads as a reasoned and
settled policy for the days of peace as
well as war. It was a war measure and
should not be extended beyond the war
period. If, in the meantime, govern
ment control is still claimed by its
friends to be what is needed, final de
cision upon the matter should not be left
to the claimants, but to the people who
are to be served and have a right to elect
a Congress on the issue involved. To
prejudge the question and demand a per
petuity of what is admittedly a war
measure is certainly presumptuous.
CULMBACK COAL.
“Culmback” is a name which miners
give to refuse which accumulates near
the mouth of the mines. It is fre
quently seen in huge piles anywhere
from 20 to 50 feet high. It is composed
of shale, fine coal and coal dust. It is
worth very little for fuel. At many
mines which have been worked for a
long time the amount of culmback has
become an actual feature of the land
scape. On the 12th day of this month 25
carloads of this culmback was received
in Boston. Complaints were made ,to
Mr. Storrow, fuel administrator for Mas
sachusetts, and he sent a protest to
Washington. He was not able to get
much satisfaction, however, and it seems
that somebody may have forgotten that
c arloads of real coal can be forwarded to
Boston as quickly as carloads of refuse.
It may be that the coal barons may
have taken the opportunity to do a little
profiteering without any authority. If
this is the case the fuel administrator
should administer more than a rebuke to i
tne coal barons. If these fellows have ;
been cheating, Professor Garfield should !
punish them by requiring the translation I
of a hundred lines of some Hebrew classic. I
—
BOLO PASHA.
This man was one of a coterie of French
men brought together under his leader
ship for the purpose of inciting the
French people to rebel against the carry
ing on of the war. His was but one
branch of the propaganda which is being
fostered in nearly every country of the
world by the Germans. We have it here
in virulent and somewhat open action.
It is even rife in Mexico and has been for
several years. Bolo Pasha was not only
the organizer of the pro-Germans and j
pacifists of France but he was the pay- i
master as well, having been supplied with !
vast sums of German money. Part of
this money was used in purchasing a ]
newspaper to be the medium through
which discontent and treason might be
fomented. He was detected, tried, con
victed by military court martial and sen
tenced to be shot. Exit Bolo Pasha. Per
haps after we have lost a hundred thou
sand men fiffhtinff the enemv we mav
develop sufficient nerve to administer
swift punishment to some of the men
who are in semi-secret, plotting actively
and with effect here in the United States.
At a meeting of the Republican Na
tional committee held Feb. 13th, in St.
Louis, Will H. Hays of Indiana was elect
ed chairman. It was expected that there
would be a contest but final action was
harmonious. The committee adopted a
resolution that national committeemen
should be regarded as the head of the
party in their respective States. In the
next general election the Republicans ex
pect to secure control of both the Senate
and House of Representatives, when it is
hoped that there will be less attention
paid to dictation higher up, less talk apd
more speedy dispatch of urgent business.
A Salt Lake newspaper states that
there is enough beet sugar in the fac
tories of Utah and Idaho to load 1200
freight cars. We are not going to wait
for it to get here. We have left an order
with our grocer for two pounds to be de
ivered when he gets another dole from
the food administrator.
When we purchase a pound of flour we
may purchase four pounds of potatoes as
a wheat substitute. Don’t hoard, but
stock up to the legal limit. Buy 30 pounds
of flour and two bushels of potatoes.
Verily the gods do smile upon us.
The Senate investigations have not
proved to be entirely useless. Several
of our swivel chair officials show sign^of
a partial assumption of mental and phya
ical activity. In other words, some of
them are beginning to hustle.

DAIRY PRODUCTION.
At a time when so m uch is being said
of the need of increasing the output ot
all food products, it is especially perti
nent to call attention to the need of
greater efficiency and economy in dairy
management. The milch cow is the
most economical agent known for chang
ing raw material into the animal- fats so
necessary for human food. (The average
cow produces in her lifetime as much fat
as seventeen steers.' Our problem is to
so run this machine as to insure a con
tinued supply of these essential foods.
To be of real value to the community
or nation, the manufacture of any food
must give a product more valuable than
the raw materials and labor costs involv
ed in the process. That is, any attempt
to persuade the farmer to make milk,
cream or butter regardless of cost, simply
defeats its own end. First, because the
resulting product is less valuable than
the cost of production. Second, because,
in the long run, if dairying does not pay,
the average farmer-will go into some
other line of business. To make dairy
mg pay its essential part in the present
food crisis, vve must put it on a sound
business basis.
Economical production is secured in
two general ways: By increasing the
output and by reducing the cost per unit.
At a time of such high feed and labor
charges, only the best cows can be profit
able. All boarders should be weeded out
by the aid of Test Associations or private
testing. Herds so selected should be
handled to give the longest possible ser
vice in both milking and breeding. Such
practices as using up cows in one or two
forced productions must be stopped if our
present herds are to be maintained. Fi
nally, the dairyman cannot alford to let
the present cost of feed prevent his rais
ing all promising heifer calves.
To some extent, feeding expenses can
be reduced by tie judicious substitution
of home-grown feeds, notably, early-cut
clover, hay and silage for the more expen
sive purchased grains. However, in his
desire to lower the cost of feeding, the
experienced feeder will not lose sight of
the fact that a heavy milking cow can
not eat enough of these feeds alone for
profitable production. The economical
ration combines a reasonable amount of
concentrates with high quality home
grown roughage.
As the labor cost of caring for cows is
practically equal to the cost of feed, any
saving in that line is now doubly im
portant. In large herds, milking ma
chines can often save the time of one or
more men. Improved stabling and water
ing arrangements may do much to re
duce overhead charges, and every dairy
man should carry as many cows as pos
sible for the help employed.
Prices sufficient to cover the greatly
increased cost of making dairy products
are necessary to assure a continued sup
ply during the war. Milk, we cannot do
without, and everyone who has consid
ered the matter will agree that dairymen
have not in the past made even fair in
terest on their investment. This fact,
however, is no valid excuse for waste
fulness or inefficiency in dairy manage
ment. In dairy products, as in all the
necessaries of life, the public now has a
right to demand the most possible for its
money and, in giving this, the dairyman
insures the future prosperity of his own
business while he supplies one on his
country’s most pressing needs.

Man the New Ships.
Fifty thousand men are needed for
crews in the New Merchant Marine. This
number includes officers, sailors, firemen,
oilers, water-tenders, coal-passers, cooks
and stewards.
Men who have served as sailors are
expected to come forward for service as
officers or able seamen. Experienced
firemen, oilers or water-tenders may se
cure good jobs at once.
Men who have not been to sea will be
trained for the w'ork they are best quali
fied to take up.
The most desirable age for inexperi
enced applicants is from 17 to 27.
Citizens in every State are urged to
come forward for this vital national
work on the sea.
American merchant sailors not only
are doing war work of the greatest im
portance; they also are laying a founda
tion for their country’s unprecedented
commercial expansion on the seas, to be
realized when peace returns.
The merchant sailor’s job is not merely
a war job. It is permanent.
This is a purely voluntary service.
There is no drafting of men for the Mer
chant Marine^
The volunteer for this service “signs
articles,” the same as a mariner bound on
a voyage, agreeing to serve under the U.
S. Shipping Board, as his official superior,
to the end of the war.
Never before in the history of our
country have the rewards of service in
the Merchant Marine, and the chances of
rapid advancement for American sailors,
been so great as now.
The World War is to be won by ships.
The whole world cries “Ships, ships, more
ships!”
Merchant ships are the kind most need
I ed—the kind manned by merchant sail
ors.
The work of the Shipping Board in
producing a great fleet, of cargo vessels
for the Merchant Marine of the United
States, in response to this world-wide
demand for ships, insures a leading place
for this country as a maritime nation.
The American people are now alive to
the importance of building and manning
a Merchant Marine that shall be limited
nnKr KirtKa nmintrv’c nrnHnrtivp ranucit.v
in ships and men.
Sections of the country that never be
fore had direct interest in shipping now
see that it is vital to their prosperity and
S security.
All this means that the manhood of
! America must take up the business of
seagoing on an unprecedented scale.
No man who has ever been a sailor can
justify himself if now he stays ashore,
in the time of his country’s need of his
services.
Every experienced sailor with capacity
to learn scientific navigation now has an
opportunity to become an officer in the
Merchant. Marine.
Men without seagoing experience, but
: with determination to become sailors,will
now be aided directly by the government
in carrying out their patriotic purpose to
| serve at sea.
For the first time in the history of the
! Merchant Marine the country has a na
i tional system of training such men for
sea service—that administered by the
Sea Training Bureau of the U. S. Ship
ping Board’s Recruiting Service.
The inexperienced man trained by the
course of instruction provided by the
Sea Training Bureau will become quali
i fied in the shortest possible tiyie to serve
his country in its merchant fleets. When
I he has finished his training as an appren
tice he will take his place in actual work
at sea beside experienced men who will
respect his legal status among them. Not
i only the sailors, but the firemen, coal
: passers, oilers, water-tenders, cooks and
, stewards that come off the training ships
; will start in their new tasks with the
knowledge that they are wanted and wel
come on the new vessels of the Merchant
Marine.
A graduate from the Shipping Board’s
training ships who has had some actual
experience about the water—especially if
it has been yachting experience—usually
may qualify as a boatswain or quarter
master after a few months in actual ser
vice.
The young American merchant sailor
knows that after a total of two years’
sea experience he may enter a Shipping
Board school in navigation to fit himself
for an officer’s license; that in three
years he can pass through all three
grades as mate—/id, 2d and lift in order—
and that his next step in promotion is to
the command of a ship.
All interested may apply to Maine Hills
at the City Drug Store, who is the re
cruiting agent for Belfast.

NORTHPORT.
Although a large portion of the snow
had been removed from the bowling
alley, connected with The Waquoit at
Northport, owned and managed by Mrs.
Lillian C. Ross, the building, containing
two alleys, collapsed about 7.30 on the
night of Feb. 12th with a loud crash
which startled the few residents of the
summer resort. The building is 80 feet
long and 20 wide and together with the
alleys was worth 33000. The snow on the
roof became so heavy with the falling
rain that the side walls spread letting the
roof fall in, taking with it tons of snow
and ice. It is feared that the alleys will
j be ruined beyond repair. Mrs. Ross and
j her sister, Mrs. Peirson, are spending the
winter at The Waquoit. Many people
| throughout Maine have bowled on the
! Waquoit alleys and will regret this acci
i dent and the big financial loss to the own
j er. Mrs. Ross does not plan to rebuild
and refurnish the alley this coming sea
son owing to the high eost of building
material and labor and the fact that so
many of the young people who come to
Northport are in the service.

NE¥F V.ORK STOCK MARKET . 1
Features of the Day's Dealings in All j
the Leading Stocks
New York, March Rails were the re
deeming feature of today’s stock market,
their Impressive activity and strength
far exceeding dealings lti any other quar
ter of the list. Reading was the outst&nd- ■
ing issue. Its rise of 6 1-3 points being at- !
tended by a turnover greater In volume {
than that accorded any other stock, in- ;
eluding the usual leaden.
The Inquiry for transportations, im
pelling extensive short covering, was cu- j
incident with reports of forthcoming de- i
velopments favorable to those propoertles.
More likely, however, the advance was j
predicated upon a growing belief in their i
potential value.
Trans-continentals, grangers and trunk
lines accompanied the movement of coal- i
ers. Union Pacific recovering Its 2S-polnt
dividend. Low priced issues embracing
the western and southern divisions were
stimulated Into unusual prominence hv
the semi-annual statement of the South
ern Railway, hich disclosed a very sub
stantial net Increase for that period.
The general list attained its highest lev
els in the final hour, publication of the
favorable government crop report creat
ing n fresh demand. United States Steel
and allied industrials profited 1 to 2
points, also shippings, equipments and
specialties.
Call money's advance from 5 to 6 per
cent, prompted moderate selling and
slight reactions from highest levels to
wards the close, but coalers and steels
held their gains. Sales amounted to Wfi.
OOO shares.
Railway bonds were visibly improved by
the rise tn stocks and Liberty issues also
strengthened Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $3.775,CM. United States bonds,
old issues, were unchanged on call.

Will say:
Relatively few reports now fail to re
flect distinct betterment of conditions,
following a winter of exceptional severi
ty and general dislocation of business
and conspicuous Instances appear of re
viving activity at sharplv rising prices.
Whtu not a few foodstuffs have leg
•rally become cheaper with the changing
season, and though certain other markets
disclos easing for different reasons, most
raw materials and finished products are
either fully sustained at high levels n»
still tend upwards, and there Is no difh
culty in selling some commodities at al
most any figure.
With the continuing relief from the
congestion in transportation the rec very
in manufacturing makes more rapid
headway and outputs are appreciably'
augmented; but where government i rods
mon°Pnl*e an increasing percentage of
mill capacity, urgent efforts to cover r-g
ular requirements are in seine cases im
pelled by fears that the paucity of sup
piles available for civilian uses may b»
Acquainted; and there* is some ppcouKiti v»- •

Christopher M. Gallup Fleeted Third
Selectman In West Hartford. Conn.
Word has been received here that
Christopher M. Gallup, a former
Local News Editor of the Independ
ent-Reporter, has been elected third
selectman in West Hartford, Conn.,
on the Democratic ticket. It is stated
that this town is normally Republi
can by a two to one majority, and
the fact that Mr. Gallup ran thirty
eight votes ahead of his ticket is par
ticularly gratifying to him.
Mr. Gallup now has a responsible
position at the head of a department
in the Travelers' Insurance Co. It
will be remembered by many that
while he was a resident of this town
he introduced the system of listing
the real estate and buildings for tax
ation separately in the town reports.

CHAPTER XI.
Over the Top.
On n:y second trip to the trenches
our officer was making his rounds of
Inspection, and we received the cheer
ful news that at four In the morning
we were to go over the top and take
the German front-line trench. My heart
turned to lead. Then the officer car
ried on with hlg Instructions. To the
best of my memory 1 recall them ns
follows: ‘‘At eleven a wiring party will
go out In front and ent lanes through
our barbed wire for the passage of
troops In the morning. At two o’clock
our artillery will open up with an In
tense bombardment, which will last un
til four. Upon the lifting of (he bar
rage the first of the three waves will
go over,” Then he left. Some of the
Tommies, first getting permission from
the sergeant, went Into the machine
gunners' dugout and wrote letters
home, saying that In the morning they
were going over the top, and also that
If tbp letters reached their destination
It would mean that the wrlt(T had been
killed.
These letters were turned over to
the captain with Instructions to mall
snme In the evest of the WTlter’s being
kflied. Some of the men made out
their wills In their pay books, under
the caption, “Will and Last Testa
ment.”
Then the nerve-racking wait com
menced. Every now and then I would
glance at the dial of my wrist watch
and was surprised to see how fast the
minutes passed hy. About five minutes
to two I got nervous waiting for our
guns to open up. I could not lake my
eyes from my wutch. I crouched
against the parapet and strained my
muscles in a deathlike grip upon my
rifle. As the hands on my watch
showed two o'clock a blinding red flare
lighted up the sky in our rear, then
thunder, Intermixed with a sharp, whis
tling sound In the air over our heads.
The shells from our guns were speed
ing on their way toward the German
lines. With one accord the men
sprang up on the fire step and looked
over the top In the direction of the
German trenches. A line of bursting
shells lighted np No Man’s Land. The
din was terrific and the ground trem
bled. Then, high above our heads we
could henr a sighing moan. Our big
boys behind the line had opened up
and 0.2’s and Ifi-lnch shells commenced
dropping Into the German lines. The
flash of the guns behind the lines, the I
scream of the shells through the air, J
and the flare of them, bursting, was a
spectacle that put Vain’s greatest dls- !
play Into the shade. The constant i
l#ip. pup. of German machine guns and
an occasional rattle of rifle firing gave
me the impression of a huge audience
applauding the work of tin1 batteries. ,
Our 18-pounders were destroying the
German barbed wire, while the heavier
stuff was demolishing their trenches ,
and hashing In dugouts or funk holes.
Then Fritz got busy.
Thoir shells went screaming over
head. aimed In the direction of the
flares from otir batteries. Trench mor
tars started dropping “Minnies"" In
otir front line. We clicked several cas
ualties. Then they suddenly censed.
Our artillery had (aped or silenced
lllt'UJ,
During the bombardment yrm could
almost rend n newspaper In our trench. ;
Sometimes in (he flare of a shell-hurst !
a man’s body would he silhouetted j
against the parados of the trench nnd 1
It appeared like a huge monster. You
could hardly hear yourself think. When ,
an order was to be passed down the
trench yon had to yell It, using your
bonds ns a funnel Into the ear of the
man Hitting next to you on the Are step.
In about twenty minutes n generous
rum Issue was doled out. After drink
ing the rum, which tasted like varnish
and Rent a shudder through your
frame, you wondered why they made
you wait until the lifting of the bar
rage before going over. At ten min
utes to four word was passed down, i
""Ten minutes to go!” Ten minutes I
to live! We were shivering all over. I
My legs felt as If they were asleep.
Then word was passed down; ""First
wave get on and near the scaling lad
ders.”
These were small wooden ladders
which we had placed against the para
pet to enable us to go over the (op on
the lifting of the barrage. ""Ladders of
death” we called them, nnd veritably
they were.
Before a charge Tommy is the po
litest of men. There Is never any push
ing or crowding to be first up these
ladders. We crouched around the base
of yie ladders waiting for the word
to go over. I was sick and faint, and
was puffing away at an unllghted fug.
Then rume the word. ‘Three minutes
to go; upon the lifting of the barrage
and on the blast of the whistles, ‘Over
the top with the best o’ lurk nnd give
them hell.’ ” The famous phrnse of
the western front. The Jonah phrnse
of the western front. To Tommy it
means If you are lucky enough to come
back you will be minus an arm or n
leg. Tommy hates to be wished the
best of luck ; so, when peace Is de
clared, If It ever Is, and you meet a
Tommy on therstreet. Just wish him the 1
best of luck and duck the brick that
follows.
I glanced again at m.v wrist watch.
We all wore them and you could hardly
call us “sissies” for doing so. It was a :
minute to four. I could sea the hand
move to the twelve, then a dead si
lence. It hurt. Everyone looked up
to see whnt had happened, but not for
long. Sharp whistle blasts rang out
along the trench, and with a cheer the
men scrambled up the ladders. The
bullets were cracking overhead, and
occasionally a machine gun would rip 1
nnd tear the top of the sandbag para
pet. How I got up that ladder I will
never know. The Bret ten feet out In
front was agony. Then we passed
through lane* In oar barbed wire. 1 j
knew I was running, hut could feel no
motion below (Tie 'vnHt. riiTcliea on
tlio ground scorned to float to the rear
ns If I were on a treadmill and scen
ery was rushing past me. The Ger
man# had put a barrage (,f shrapnel
across No Man's Land, and you could
hear the pieces slap the ground about
you.
Afler I had passed our barbed wire
and gotten into No Man's Land a
Tommy about fifteen feet to my right
front turned around and looking in my
direction, put his hand to his mouth
and yelled something which I could not
make out on account of the noise from
the bursting shells. Then he coughed,
stumbled, pitched forward and lay still.
Ilis body seemed to float to the rear
of me. I cotfld bear sharp cracks In
I he air about me. These were caused
by passing rifle bullets. Frequently,
to my right and left, little spurts of
dirt would rise Into the air and a rico
chet bullet would whine on its way.
It n Tommy should see one of these
Ihtle spurts in front of him, he would
tell the nflrse nbout It later. The
crossing of No Man's Land remains a
bltmk to me.
Men on my right and left would
stumble and fall. Some would try to
get up, while others remained huddled
and motionless. Then smushed-up
barbed wire came Into view anil
seemed carried on a tide to the rear.
Suddenly, In front of me loomed a
bashed-ln trench about four feet wide.
Quqpr-Iooklng forms like mud turtles
were s-.ambling up its wall. One of
these forms seemed to slip and then
rolled lo the bottom of the trench. I
leaped across this Intervening space.
The man to my left seemed to pnuse in
midair, then pitched hqnd down Into
the German trench. I laughed out loud
In my delirium. Upon alighting on tfce
other side of the trench I came to with
a sudden Jolt. Right in front of me
loomed a giant form with a rifle which
looked about ten feet long, on the end
of which seemed seven bayonets. These
flashed in the nlr In front of me. Then
through my mind flashed the admoni
tion our bayonet instructor buck In
Blighty. He had said, ""whenever you
get In a charge and run your bayonet
up to the hilt into»n German the Fritz
will fall. Perhaps your rifle will he
wrenched from your grasp. Ho not
waste time. If the bayonet is fouled
In his equipment, by putting your foot
on his stomach and tugging at the rifle
to extricate the bayonet. Simply
press the trigger and the bullet will
free If."" In my present sltuntion this
was the logic, but for the life of me
I could not remember how he had told
me to get my bayonet Into the Ger
man. To me tills was the paramount
issue. I closed my eyes and lunged
forward. My rifle was torn from my
hands. I must have gotten the Ger
man because he bail disappeared.
About twenty feet to my left front
was a huge Prussian nearly six feet
four Inches In height, a flue specimen
of physical manhood. The bayonet
from his rifle was missing, but he
clutched the barrel In both hands and
wus swinging the butt around his bend.
I could almost hear the swish of the
butt pissing through the nlr. Three
little Tommies were engaged with him.
They looked like pigmies alongside of
the Prussian. The Tommy on the left
was gradually circling to the rear of
Ills opponent, it was a funny sight to
see thiin duck ttie swinging butt nnd
try to jati him ut the same time. The
Tommy nearest me received the butt
of the German's rifle In a smashing
blow below the right temple. It
smashed his bead like an eggshell. He
pitched forward on his side and n con
vulsive shudder ran through his body.
Meanwhile the other Tommy bad
gained the rear of the Prussian. Sud
denly about four Inches of bayonet
protruded from the throat of-the Prus
sian soldier, who staggered forward
and fell. I will never forget the look
of blank astonishment that came over
Ids face.
Then something lilt me in the left
shoulder and my left side went nunth.
It felt as If a hot poker was being
driven through me. I felt no pain—
Just a sort of nervous shock. A bay
onet had pierced me from the rear. I
fell hnckwnrd on the ground, but was
not unconscious, because I could see
dim objects moving around me. Then
a tlnsh of light In front of my eyes and
unconsciousness. Something hnd hit
me on the head. J have never found
out what It wns.
I dreamed I was being toRsed about
In nn open boat on a heaving sen and
opened my eyes. The moon wus shin
ing. I was on a slretcher being car
ried down one o* our communication
trenches. At the advanced first-aid
post my wounds were dressed, and
then I was put Into nn ambulance and
sent to one of the l ase hospitals. The
wounds in my shoulder nnd head were
not serious and In six weeks I had re
joined my company for service In the
front line.

Zeppelin's Rust Raid,” shown at the,
Colonial today only, one feature of a1
big special program.
Revealing to the world for the first |
time the secrets of the Zeppelin by j
which Germany has waged ruthless,
warfare upon the Allies aince the be- >
ginning <f( the great war. ""The Zep
pelin's Rast Raid,” Thomas H. Inee's
iirst great spectacle since he gave
""Civilisation” to the World, will takej
rank as one of the most- remarkable
screen productions of recent years.
""The Zeppelin's Rast Raid,” ia pic-j
tured in blood and fire. There is no es-1
cape from its utter drama. It rusnfcej
you on and on. breathless for the se
quel. It carries you miles away from
yie four tight walls of the theatre. A
whole vast country is the stage, field,
roads, villages and cities, the sea and
far into the air in the mighty death
dealing dirigibles of the Prussians!
""The Zeppelin's Rast Raid” doesn't
suggest. It does. It boldly and thrill- \
ingle sets forth in actual pictures the
PGtcesses of a wonderful dramatic'
imagination. For in this latest of Inee!
Triumphs C. Gardner Sullivan, who
white ""Civilisation"" and many other of
the lnce successes, has taken for Ins ;
subject the growing spirit of democratic
revoluti m throughout the German. Um
pire, giving to the production a mo
mentous timeliness tiiat is bound to fo
cus tiic attention of thinking people the
world over. New York is now pre
paring against the raids of these mighty
fiends of the air. ^ee this great picture
today!
Fear] White, the great screen favorite,
w 1! be seen in breathlessly exciting sit
uations in ""The House of Hate.” See

The Incendiary.
The American Defense Society has
copyrighted an article, written b>
Emerson Hough, from which we clip
the following:
“It is an incendiary fire. The nest
of the incendiaries lies yonder in the
Black Forest of Germany. From that
den of robbers and thieves has issued
from time to time, ever since history
began, horde after horde of ruffians,
w ho have marched out to batter at the
gates <»i civilization higher and bet
ter than their own. They have des
troyed the beautiful things of Home
and Rheims, of Paris and Ypres,
Eondnn ;<nd a score more of cities
great and small. They have destroyed
the a< cumulated treasures of the
ages, the art, the beauty of the world,
things without price, never to be re
placed. They have always slain
women and children ruthlessly—or
done worse than to slay. They were
barbarians at the first and they are
barbarians now. They were in
cendiaries at the first and they are
incendiaries now. As they have lived
by the sword, so must they perish by
the sword. Firebugs of the world,
they must find their fit place on the
lamp-posts of the world—and they
will do so. That ancient nest of in
famy whose center is Berlin is to be
wiped out now.
PUL >> CcLIlIlUt. LcliYC It UUL 111 will
ing about it, or in talking about it.
There is no time even to think about
it. They; have set our homes on
fire. What are we going to DO about
it?
""Thank God, at last, the wail of the
siren is heard, coming closer and
closer, arid the feet of horses gallop
ing. and of men running. Down the
street, there are smokes of other en
gines coming. The wires are asking
help from other vilalges beside our
own.
""The house of the world is on fire.
The temple of our civilization is on
fire. The store-house of our accumu
lated savings of centuries is on fire.
The property of the world and the
life of the world are at stake. Shall
we wait? Shall we explain? Or
shall we brook explanation?”
In the same mail we find an indict
ment of the German people by Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw in which she
says:
""It is unnecessary to repeat the
shocking details of the atrocities in
flicted upon women and children of
Belgium. Flanders, Poland. Armenia
to realize the debasing effect of mili
tarism on man in times of hatred
and war. But we must admit that
such violation of right, such cruel
barbarism could tie possible only as
the result of moral delinquencies in
times of peace.
""The whole trend of militarism as
exemplified in the Prussianism of to
day is to silence all moral and spir
itual aspiration in national life. The
emphasis placed upon a large birth
rate for the purpose of increasiTlg the
military power and material strength
of the Empire, without regard to
ethical laws of social life, as shown
by the vast army of illegitimate par
ents and of children bereft of home
influence and moral ideals, children
who are taught from their earliest
infancy in institutions which are
their only homes, the lessons of na
tional pride and national glory and
strict obedience to autocratic rulers
and. in addition to that, hatred and
contempt for the people of other
lands.
“There is ail the evidence needed to
prove the moral and spiritual degen
eracy of a people controlled by a sys
tem which finds its expression in the
frightfulness that has made a vast
part of Europe a barren waste, and of
industrious and peace-loving people
slaves or^refugees from their land
and homes. * * • In no ou'er na
tion could the Hymn of Hate be
taught and sung in schools save in
that country whose very name has
become a bvword of shame .anil dis
gust to civilization.
if these crimes and indecencies
were confined to the army, or even
to the countries overrun by the army,
we might hope that civilian life had
escaped their blighting taint, but
when we realize that civil rulers are
In conquered territories, that farmers
and heads of various institutions and
industries in the home '.and are deal
ing with exiled and enslaved people
•and doing in cold blood, apparently
without any remorse or conscience,
the things that fill the civilized world
with horror, we must recognize the
far-reaching influence of militarism
upon a people.
“If such a system were permitted
to conquer in this struggle it would
wrest from the free people of the
world not alone their freedom and
their Ideals of democratic Justice,
which through generations of priva
tion, perseverance, and indomitable
will they have wrung from the past,
but it would crush all the achieve
ments of peaceful industry, of educa
tion, and especially of spiritual as
piration, which are the hard-earned
fruits of these generations of world
service.
""We must save our children from
the debasing spirit of militarism if
American men and women are ever
again to hope for the things they
have cherished, and from which their
ancestors sought to escape when
they defied the tyranny of the domi
nation of might and gave to the
world the democratic ideals of jus
tive and equality in the immortal
Declaration of Independence to which
our flag and our country are dedi
cated.’’

r Save the Cost of Annual Folly
Remember that National War
Savings Day is June 28. Pledge
yourself on or before that day to
save to the utmost of your ability
and to buy War Savings Stamps
that there may be more money,
labor, and materials to back up
those who fight and die for you.—
National War Savings Com.
One of the ways in which we can
save to aid the government and stand
behind our brave fighters in Europe,
is to eliminate the expenditures for
noise, fireworks and foolishness on
the Fourth of July. The chap who
attempts this non-es.sential “business
as usual” this year should be ignored
ty the public, young and old.
On our hands we have a bigger
Job than senselessly celebrating old
victories in reckless waste and crim
inal folly.
Let’s permit the 700,000 American
warriors said by the head of the War
Department to be in Europe, mane
the noise and shoot off the fireworks
this year. Shall we indulge in anti:-s
over old victories while thousands of
American homes are mourning the
casualties of the hour? Rather let us
save the millions of dollars that
usually figure as the kindling of mil
lions loss in tires, and cost of life and
limb, in war savings.
Who Said ""Politics Is Adjourned""?
The Democratic leaders in Con
gress who objected to dealing with
the revenue problem at this session
were naive if not nervy in the rea
sons which they advanced in support
of their position. They said that it
would be hard enough for them, in
any event, to retain party control of
Congress in the approaching election
and that new taxes imposed now
would make it impossible for them to
remain in power. In consequence,
they pleaded that the Treasury
should be permitted to go hang until
after November, at least, while they
went home and tried to elect a
Democratic majority in the next

elements of confession—which is said
to be good for the soul. It admitted
that a tax law, drawn by Democrats,
would contain crudities and inequali
ties which would render it unpala
table to the voters; and it admitted
also that Democratic leaders place
the interests of their party above the
interests of the nation.
It is inconceivable that Republicans
will let the occasion pass without
commenting upon this phase of
Democratic policy—which would he
bad enough in time of peace, but
which in time of war, amounts t<*>
downright malfeasance. By thus per
versely seeking to neglect the na
tional necessity, the Democratic
party has committed an offence
parallel to that which a military
commander in the field would com
mit if he neglected to defend an ex
posed position or if he neglected to
attack when the necessity for attack
arose. This war is not to be won by
postponement—either of military or
of financial preparation. The waiting
game is the Germans’ game. We
have played it too long already in
some respects. And with our men in
the trenches resisting Hindenburg, it
is no time for slackers at home to be
seeking political advantage at the
expense of a vital point of national
defence.
American unanimity is strikingly
shown in the proceedings of two
American conventions, held at widely
separated points by bodies of men that
In times of peace would find little in
common for discussion. The Federation
of Labor and the American Medical
Sorietv both devoted their sessions to
""Win the War.""—New York World.
; Of course the World will fail to
notice that the president of the
American Medical Association, in a
notable address, urged national pro
jhibition for the benefit of military
and civil populations alike; that
science and education should elimi
nate not only plagues and epidemics,
but also the curse of drink from the
! world.”
. _
Inasmuch as the President and Mr.
Hoover are afraid to halt the waste
of food and fuel in beer, because they
think it might drive some people to
hardstuff, they should receive the
same argument from the people as
did little Willie from his stern father.
Son Willie “feared"" the shingle might
injure his pants arei was met with:
""My son. take them off."" Let the
President first ""take off"" the whiskey
and other distilled liquors, and thi n
submit to the country's greatest war
saving and war prosecution.
An Augusta business man, com
menting on the recent awning fires,
said that two precautions should be
taken: first, care in disposal of
matches and cigar and cigaret stubs,
and next, fireproofing of awnings. He
said it could be done at small cost
and would have prevented, probably,
any one of the three fires recorded.
It is a clairmworthy of investigation.

Two more soldier boys left for the
war last week, Elmer Saunders and
Silas Keniston of Locke’s Mills (for
merly of Albany), son of Asa Kenis
ton of South Paris, says the Norway
Advertiser, which continues: It makes
us think of old times when Albany
sent 10 of its smartest young nun
for three years, who volunteered and
entered the 16th, 17th and 20th Maine
Regiments. Out of the 10 only one
of the young men returned without
getting shot, or died in the hospital
or was discharged for disability. Five
of the numiier were shot in the great
Rattle of Wilderness, one was badly
wounded, George H. Holt in the last
battle of the Civil War, had a bullet
shot through his lungs. He still lives
in the far West today unless he has
passed along recently. L. N. Cum
mings, a brother of D. A. Cummings,
tiie youngest soldier of the 10, only
18 years of age when he enlisted, still
lives in Melrose, Mass. After the war
was over he came back and entered
Gould’s Academy at Bethel and fitted
for college and graduated at the
Wesleyan University of Middletown,
Conn. He never got a scratch dur
ing the three years of hard fighting.
He was a member of Company B, 20th
Me. Regiment.
The Sangerville correspondent of
the Guilford Register tells the follow
ing:
Well it certainly is surprising, the
faith some men have in the forces of
nature. Only last week one of our
respected townsmen was discover sd
planting onions, bottom side up, and
he expected a good yield by fall. He
was persuaded to turn them over, but
we pity his advisor, if he doesn't suc
ceed.
This is the first season in 55 years
that Lucius H. Duncan hasn’t vended
Penobscot river salmon, from his
weir at Northport. Facts of the case
are that the ex-alderman disposed of
his salmon privilege and gear last
season, and is now serving as boss
eauker at the North Marine Railway,
i Mr. Duncan has caught as high as
i 250 salmon, and considered 125 a
i good average. “You can’t fool me
with St. John salmon,” declares the
veteran.
_
Moose are emboldened by their
long period of protection from hunt
ers, extending from 1915 to 1919,
judging by their visits to civilization,
says the Commercial. A Lagrange
man in the city Thursday said that a
moose recently walked through the
streets of that town in the morning
and disappeared in the woods. On
the Ellsworth road, near Holden a
cow moose Monday night stood in the
road fascinated by the headlights of
an automobile occupied by Hon. E.
C. Ryder and Edward Graham of the
B. It. & E. Co. and Judge Cleaves and
W. B. Skelton of the Public Utilities
; Commission. They thought it was a
horse at first.

September to accept the superintend

thing every day, and he added some
j what to his stock of knowledge when
he found Raphael Sherman cultivat
j i.ng his backyard garden with a clam
hoe. Jlr. Sherman informed the
j agricultural specialist that he used a
clam hoe because he was raising
""shell"" beans.
Sylvester in the Portland Press has
i the following, which is worth read
■ ing and pindering over:
1 I wonder what has become of the
federal law which forbids the use of
feathers of birds on hats worn by
women. It may be that in the rush
. of war legislation this has been re
pealed wit! out my knowledge or con
; sent. But If it has not been repealed
jand is still supposed to be in force,
it is one oi the least enforced laws
; we have on any of our statute books.
I make this statement advisedly and
'after a naif hour spent in reviewing
a parade of finely dressed women not
long ago. There must be a screw loose
; somewhere or else the women are
■wearing some very old hats and I
hardly thirk this could be possible. I
, am much afraid that like a great
many other 'laws this one. excellent
jin its intent and praiseworthy in
I every respect, has been pushed aside
in favor of newer ones which have
; more of the support of present day
public sentiment and that in conse
! quence tbeie not being officers enough
to enforce, all of the laws there are,
this one uas been side-tracked for the
present and probably for all times un
| less somebody sees fit to take it up
again.

Dear Mother:
Will drop you a short letter today to (
let you know that I am well and happy
and hope you are the same. Enclosed '
you will find a few lines for Mother’s'
day.
It rains hut the world is mellow
In a soothing sort of way,
I .ike the world is weeping, weeping,
For our Mothers far away.
Who knows she may be praying
And low is her head of gray,
Prayers for her gallant soldier
On this, his Mother's day.
There is nothing so sweet to a soldier t
As thoughts of his Mother dear,
Tt seems he thinks about her more
When a day like this is here.
Let your letters he tong to your mother1
On this the twelfth of May.
Make her think your life is pleasant |
Make her know you're feeling gay. j
!
And though the day is rainy
Though file sun gives never a ray, j
Make believe the birds are singing,
For today is our Mother’s day.
Will close for this time with love to
all. From your son,
Leiand W. Niles.

Charles S. Davis, first class private, '
Company G, 103d Infantry, formerly .
of Augusta, recently writes as fol- j
lows to his wife, Mrs. Charles S.
Davis:
In our start we had very hard
training, morning till night, then it
came night and days for a while.
We threw all kinds of bombs and
grenades, the real ones. It was some j
experience on the start, but every j
man was right there with the goods. '■
They care for nothing. Then came
our practice in trenches day and
night, and the sending up of the
rockets to know ihe meaning of dif
ferent lights, and the illumination or
flaro rocket that light^ up No Man's '
Land, for going over the top and
making attacks. It was very inter- i
r sting. Then came a call for real j
business to the front lines. A tire- i
some riae it was. men our nrst ex- ,
porience for our eyes to see the
trenches and wire entanglements. ;
Then all the ruined villages, people ,
living underground and all kinds of ;
places. Our first experience was to i
go into a hig cave 40 or 50 feet un- j
der ground. There were electric 1
lights and bunks or immitation cots '
to sleep on. It. was damp and
musty in there, but it was quite com- j
fortahle too. Lights had to be used i
all the time it was so dark. The ;
cave would hold a whole regiment or
perhaps more. There were many
larger ones. Very often the shells
came over making us a visit. While
we were in that cave we saw an air
fight between two French and ono
American plane against a Roche
plane, but they got the Roche. The
machine guns of (he planes were i
going it like everything and was j
quite a battle. The Roche turned ;
upside down and fell many thousand j
feet. He was killed. Jt wasn’t long
after that before many of the hoys of
different companies had a piece of ;
the machine. Then another fight be
tween the French observation balloon
and Roche airplane. He got the
balloon and set it afire by boml<s but
the fellow got out in time and came
down in his parachute and landed |
safely. Then we began to go dig- j
ging trenches in second lines, hiked j
a few miles from the cave, do this at 1
night. Our first surprise was to meet |
with a number of big shells and
w hat a noise they made. Of course I
we had to stop digging and to hug j
to the bottom of the trench, although
that is where we begun to get used ■
to gun fire. Somehow' they found out ;
our being there and tried to scare us
out. nothing doing. Rut they stopped
alter awhile and nobody was hurt.
Then we. started back borne. It was
so every night we dug and we went
there every night until we went, in.
Then came the real stuff. They
thought they were going to drive us
out the first thing, but they met with
a big surprise. They tried it two
nights in succession, but no use.
Their barrages took no effect on us
and gas also. We were there a num
ber of days then went back in ihe ;
reserve for a few days. Then In j
again to go on another sector and met |
with the same results. Relieve me, j
there was some lively going, al- [
though the boys were there with
smiles and done the work as though
there was no shells coining at all. |
The sky was very light from the .
flash of the big guns and shells
bursting. This is nil done nt night j
mostly. We were always ready to |
meet them when they started their j
heavy gun fire and what a noise, i
Also the Roche had a notion of visit- I
ing us quite often with machine gun )
fire from the airplanes. Now that we ;
have heard so much noise from the
guns and shell fire, wo feci out of
place when getting back out of gun 1

fire. We have been right on the go j
since the 2d of February. We have I
been only four days away from the
lings out of the sound of the heavy '
guns. The boys are all feeling pretty ;
well. We have fairly good places to j
sleep in sometimes. And the eats at
times are fairly good and plenty of !
it. This is since we have got our
new- mess officer, and he knows his
business. The Lieutenant of our
platoon can t be beat. He has good
nerve and plenty of it to lead his
men. Lieut. Foss of the 4th Platoon.
W hen he gives an order we are right
behind him. We would follow* him
through H—. That is how good he
is. He knows his business. 1 have
followed them everywhere on all the ■
long marches. The last time out of '
the front lines we started on our j
long march of four days and a half 1
on the road and covering 90 miles, j
We were pretty tired in the end.
After getting something to eat felt
much better. To where we are now :
we have marched about 150 miles, j
The boys are all hard as rocks, also
the hard drilling in snow- and slush. !
rain and snow storms and wading up \
to your knees stormy days don’t stop j
the drills, or we couldn't do it. The
men over in the state w-il) linti a big '
proposition on their shoulders trying |
to follow us. Our experience is (great j
and we met it with the greatest of;
luck, and don’t mind it. Still we all !
have the feeling to be home once
more to see our loved ones, wives, |
mothers and sweethearts. 1 ha$e had
a painful shoulder through ‘it all.
It will always bother me 1 expect
unless I get an operation, which 1
expect after my return to the .rest
camp. There are many more I would
like to mention but 1 cannot. We
have had many thrilling experiences
and don't realize them all, but the
nerves are good. We a,so have’the
Salvation Army people with us.
We have enjoyed ourselves more
with them. We have seen many air
battles and other battles. The people
sent us away as Roy Scouts but the
Boy Scouts can show* them all what
to do, most especially the. 26th. If
ever we return all of us. they do not
want to mention it again, for we can
tight and have got the name of it.
With love, your husband, N

Another Tame Trout.

The following clipped from a
newspaper has been mailed to Maine •
Woods and the little story has a fa- '
miliar ring. The hero instead of the |
bearded ""Sage of Beaver Bond"" is a
bare-foot boy of 10 but otherwise the '
story is essentially the same as told >
bv Ed (irant and chronicled by Fran
cis Maule.
A Fish Out of Water.
One day Tom. a 10-year-old coun- :
try boy, went fishing for trout in a
stream near his house. He had been
fishing there a good many times but '
had not succeeded in catching any
large fish.
This particular day he caught a
large trout. He was overjoyed at
his unusual luck. He decided to
Keep it for a pet.
He took it home and put It in a •
barrel of water under the trees.
Every- day for two weeks he took
the fish out so tha^ he would get
used to being out of the water. The
next two weeks ho put it on the
dew covered grass in the shade.
The fish lived and seemed to en- |
joy this way of living.
He then put it in the sun and in '
the dusty road. It followed him
around without difficulty and it was
like a dog to him. Tom would'al
ways know when the fish was be
hind him* because as it wiggled;
along he could hear Us tail flap.
One morning Tom had to go to '
town on an errand. The. fish fol
lowed. On his way to town he had
to cross a bridge and as Tom j
reached the other side, he realized
that the fish was not making any j
noise. He. turned around only to I
find that the fish had slipped
through a crack into the water and
was floating on its back—drowned! ;

ind for the last 12 years haz used a j

MENTAL CLINICS
IN PORTLAND
Portland, Me., June 12.—Forrest C.
Tyson, superintendent of the Augus
ta State Hospital, sends out the fol
lowing communication:
“In connection with the care and
treatment of mental diseases, the
management of the Augusta State
Hospital has definitely decided to es
tablish in tiie city of Portland, a
Psychopathic Service for the benefit
of those in the community who are
in any way suffering from mental or
nervous abnormality.
This particular effort along' the
lines of social service, is independent
of an other organized agency and will
be conducted ethically and scientifi
cally, in accordance with the meth
ods of the latest psychiatric knowl
edge, making available for the first
time outside, of the hospital, the ex
pert diagnosis and advice of the State
Hospital physicians.
In offering such a service, which
has for its sole object, conservation
of mental health of the public at
large, it is the earnest desire of those
in charge that all persons feeling the
need of advice or examination, will
feel free to present themselves, that
physicians may refer their mental
cases for consultation and that or
ganized agencies having mental or
difficult cases with anti-social ten
dencies. will avail themselves of the
opportunity of referring such cases
to the clinic.
Through the courtesy of the mayor
and other public spirited citizens,
suitable accommodations have been
obtained in the City hall, and the
clinic will lie held on Wednesday of
each wiek, from 10 o'clock in the
morning until 4 in the afternoon, in
room 11.

Significant Facts
For Kennebec Republicans!
_- I
In the past 55 years, the office of County Attorney has been held by residents of the fol
lowing places in the County for the designated periods of time t
Augusta, 5, serving 23 years
Hallowell, 1, serving 4 years
Gardiner, 2, 10
Waterville, 2, 12
Winthrop, 1, 0
The foregoing list includes one Democratic County Attorney who served 2 >eaK-> ^lorn
Augusta and one from Hallowell was a Democrat. It is not the purpose of this publicity
literature to mislead or misrepresent.
What has Augusta had?—5 County Attorneys who served 23 years.
What does Augusta now have?—State Senator, Sheriff, and County Attorney who is com
pleting his Sixth Year in that Capacity.
What does Augusta ask for this year?—TWO STATE SENATORS, COUNTY COM
MISSIONER, SHERIFF, and again asks for the COUNTY ATTORNEY.
If the FIVE Augusta candidates should be successful in the June Primaries—and that is
not impossible as the cities can get out the voters much more easily than the small towns,
and that is especially true in a year like this—AUGLSTA would have 5 out ol the 8
Candidates to be voted for in September by the other 29 cities and towns.
Is it JUST for Augusta to have the County Attorney again
AT THIS TIME?
Mr. Voter:
If you do not be
lieve it is Fair Play
for Augusta to nom
inate the candidate
for County Attorney
this year, vote for
Ellsworth E. Peacock
of Readfield on June

There is no provision lot such classi

any other registrant, that. is. he shall
be classified in any one of the classes
according to his claims, or lack of

It is thercfme suggested that the
case of any registrant who has been

there is issued to him a certificate

FORMER PRINCIPAL AT
OAK GROVE HONORED
East Vassalboro, Me, June 12.—
The following clipping trom the Co
lumbia Citizen of Columbus, Ohio, of
recent date will be of interest to
many folks of this locality -who
pleasantly remember Dr. Henry H.
Goddard, at one time principal of
Oak Grove Seminary. He has many
friends in this section who will be
glad to hear of his services.
Meet the highest paid employe of
the State of Ohio—Dr. Henry H.
Goddard. His salary is $7300. Only
the governor draws more pay from
the treasury, and he is an elected
official.
Dr. Goddard's job Is to make Ohio
the world leader in child conserva
tion and in the scientific upbuilding
of citizenship.
He has just taken charge of the
Bureau of Juvenile Research at the
State Board of Administration.
The idea is to study the causes of
juvenile delinquency and check them
at the root rather than to punish
their effects. Ohio is the first state
to appropriate money to experiment
with this idea.
Because this is pioneer work, the
state got Di*. Goddard as the greatest
expert in that line in the country.
He established that reputation at an
institution in Vineland, X. J. He has
written several textbooks on juvenile
crime.
Although the Ohio Bureau of
Juvenile Research came into bring in
July, 1914. it has never fully func
tioned. The last legislature appro
priated $100,000 for the erection of a
laboratory and dormitories on the
Columbia State Hospital grounds.
It is expected these buildings will be
erected by Jan. 1.
Juvenile courts will stop sending
bad boys to Lancaster and bad girls
to Delaware. All such cases will lie
■‘committed” to the State Board of
Administration and sent to the Re
search Bureau here.
The feeble-minded will be separ
ated and committed to other insti
tutions, and those of normal mental
ity studied for the causes of their
delinquency.
it is no longer holieved that a
certain number of normal children
are bound to he bad. It is held that
most cases of delinquency are from
environments, associates. physical
ailments or some cause which can
lie studied and corrected.
ADVERTISING TURNED DOWN
Register Refused Business Which
Was Offered It Free.
(Boothbay Register. May 31)
The only thing that prevents some
people from advertising is that it
would cost money. Wo. had a visitor
this week who started right off
by telling what a big man he was
and quite a bit about the big com
pany he represents. When we told
him we were looking for advertising,
as that in what makes the pa per go.
he changed his talk to local linos
and we didn’t get the order. That's
the way with many of them, and if
the country newspaper editor doe-n't
put up a sign he has to go through
the process time and again. It is
well enough to have a little back
bone and talk straight to such

P.-opored Change for Zcnc Systam.
The s crolled zone system for the
distribution of periodicals through
tl.c mails is to broom • effective on
July 1st. in accordance with the pro
visions <•! the revenue law of last
vr.ar At the time that law was en
acted bitter opposition to the pro
posed < hangi . which amounts to a
b* untie increase in the present second
t i.iss postage rates, was manifest.
Since that dnt< tremendous pressure
has been brought to bear on senators
and representatives to repeal the
zone system before it g< es into effect.
Tim claim has been made that hun
dreds of the small publications of na
tion wpie circulation will be forced
out of business if the law is retained.
Ah an answer to those appeals, and
at the same time to preserve tlie rev
rnufe producing feature of the law.
Congressman Albert Johnson of the
Mate of Washington has introduced
a hill providing that postal charges
on second class matter shall be based
on subscription prices and circula
tion. He t-.as gone into the question
in detail, and proposes varying rates,
w Mere the circulation is .ess than 20,
oao, as follows:
Annual Postage for
subscription each annual
price subscription
l.ess than fit cents One-half cent
l cents to It 1 cent
It c't to 2 cents
lift| to t i. X cents
I t <0 to It 4 cents
$4 n| to |f., j cents
If, ill to |)t. 6 cents
When the circulation is more than
20.000 but less than 100,000 the
charges given above are to be
doubled, and if the circulation is over
100.000 they are quadrupled. If the
subscription price is over $0 then the
rate for less than 20,000 circulation is
to be 10 rents, and for more than 20,
0""0 circulation 20 cents. The postal
charges are to be payable quarterly.
Free in county privileges now en
joyed by newspapers are to remain in
force.
Germanism in American Business.
National Food Administrator
Hoover flays profiteers fore and aft.
He does not care, he says, whether it
he farmer, laborer, manufacturer,
middleman or retailer, no person in
the Fnited States has a right to
make one cent more profit out of any
employment than he would have
made under pre-war conditions.
""Every cent taken beyond this
standard is money abstracted from
the blood and sacrifice of the Ameri
can people.""
And then Mr. Hoover elaborates his
position, that none may misunder
stand, In the following:
'Extortionate profits are not
necessary to secure the maximum ef
fort on the part of the American peo
ple m this war. If wc ure going to
adopt that theory, we have admitted
everything that has been charged
against us of being the most ma
terialistic, the most avaricious, and
the most venal of people in this
world.
' If we are going to admit that the
government, in order to secure the
supreme effort of its citizens in pro
duction. must bribe them with money
to this extra exertion, we have ad
mitted a weakness of American char
acter. of American civilization and of
\meriran ideals that puts us on a
plane below German Kultur.
' Po not mistake that I am saying
thaf prices and wages should return
to the pre-war normal, because the
Incidence nr vvai before we joined it
had lifted our costs of operation, and
there must lie compensation in every
direction.
""Nevertheless. I hold that any man
who ha« made more than his neces
sary living out of the cost this nation
is giving in the blood of the boys we
are sending to France, should not
stand out as a benefactor to his
comm unity.”
Some selfish firms and individuals
•nay think they are ""getting away”
with it now. but they will find them
selves. commercially and industrially
after the war, in much the same situ
ation as Germany in world affairs—
unnecessary to business and progress.
They may think that all will be for
gotten before the war is ended and
peace arranged, but everywhere tabs
nre being kept on those who exact the
pound of flesh.
A lei of geese who lay golden eggs
ire being slaughtered by greed.
Germany'* “Modest"" Peace Program.
""n the strength of their military sit
uation in France, the Herman militarist
.oiimals apparently have been inspired
* > put forward new German peace terms
the most aggressive character, says
1 London wireless message. There is
not much talk now on peace without in
demnities and annexations. On the con
trary. there is to be the severest punish
ment for all Germany’s opponents, ac
tording to these newspapers.
The Kreuz Zcitung says that as re
gards Great Britain, victorious Germany
will require the reduction of the Brit
ish navy to a maritime police force: the
cession to an international council of 1

It is indeed, a modest program, for

In a letter to his sister. Mrs. Roy
H. Southard of Belfast. Corp. Steven
Farrell of the lOSth French Mortar
Battery writes as follows:
Your letter of the 28th of March
received. 1 was in the trenches and
could not write until now. We have
a Y. M. C. A. hut connected with our
billet and we have almost every
night a speaker, some very interest
ing ones.
We frequent the hut a lot as that
is about the only place we have to go
n.ghts. 1 have seen what you call
the horrors ol war, sure enough, the
last two weeks. Our battery has
been cited for the important part we
played, which means a little reward
coming to us.
The weather here now is like sum
mer l*ut the nights are cool. Night is
the time when there is most doing,
and \o Man's Land"" is lighted with
different colored lights—a regular
Honey Island—only fur different. It
is all very good as long as they don’t
get you.
1 have seen a few that they did
set. Yes, the French nuns place
flowers on the fellow's graves and
keep the graveyard all fixed up.
There is a crowd now watching an
aerial battle. It's quite exciting
sometimes, when six or more, get
j scraping. They are not so plentiful
now in the daytime for the U. s ma
chines are getting on the job.
I recen cd the magazines you sent
and that one with Gen. Pershing’s
picture was given a good home. You
certainly are doing your bit in send
ing me stuff. I appreciate it very
much and guess you understand mo
O. K.
1 have forgotten to tell you that
during my spare time 1 ha •*< learned
to ride horseback and it is nothing
for a few of us to ride 10 or 12 miles
for sport when we have the time, i
am in the same good health as ever.

Deputy Sheriff A. U. Robinson of
Waterville has received an interest
ing letter from John ‘Reddy” .Mc
Cormick, a member ot Company C,
Jod l . S. Infantry, who comes from
Gardiner. We quote the following:
""We are out of the trenches for a
rest. I have been to the front twice.
The first time we were there we had
fine weather and the second time it
rained all the time. We did not mind
it much as we have clothing for all
kind of weather. It is warm here
(April 25). The gardens are ploughed
and many of them planted. 1 don't
think it lias been below zero this
winter.
""There are a lot of trenches here.
You can get lost in them quicker than
you can in the streets of New York.
We snipers are in the first line of
trenches much of the time and never
get lonesome as there is a lot of
“Fourth of July"" going on. Old Fritz
can surely throw over some iron
foundries but we can put twice as
many back. He has got nothing on
us as he will find before he gets
through. He may linger but we will
nail him in the end. I have laughed to
myself lying in a sniper's post watch
ing for a German to show his head,
watching as a cat does a rat.
“If you have any men hanging
around that ‘rest room’ send them
over here, they can sure get a job.""
A TEACHER OF
“HEW THOUGHT""
Believes “FRUIT-A-TIVES” Highest
Result of “New Thought” in Medicine
MR. A. A. YOUNG
••I am not in the habit of praising
■any material medicine as I am an
advocate of New Thought (akin to
Christian Science) but some time ago.
I had such a bad attack of Liver and
'Stomach Trouble that I gave ip
thinking 1 did not have it. and took
a natural medicine, T’ruit-a-tives’ or
Fruit Liver Tablets.
Most gratifying was the result. It
relieved my liver and stomach
trouble, cleaned up my yellowish
complexion and put new blood in my
body.
While I am no backslider from ‘New
Thought', I feel there may be times
when a help to nature may be neces
sary; and if so. I believe that ""Fruit
a-tives' is the highest result of New
Thought in medicine.”

Remember three things come not back;
The arrow sent upon its track
it will not swerve, it will not stay
It speeds; it Hies to wouiul or slay.

And doing work for good or ill.

And the lost opportunity,

the following statement:
“It is believed that upwards of
forty million dollars of watered
stock is now floating down the
stream of time :n Maine's
hydraulic speculations.”
The total capital, including
stock and bonds, of all public
utility corporations doing an
electrical business and reporting
to the Public Utilities Commis
sion of fhe State of Maine is
$62,112,829.00.
This includes nil electric rail
roads in the State. which do not
develop their power but pur
chase the power from electric de
velopment companies. The capi
tal stock and bonded indebted
ness of these railroads is about
$7,000,000. There is also included
in the total amount reported to
the Utilities Commission, electric
companies operated by steam
power and certain ga-> plants
owned by companies using elec
tricity. The amount reported
al6n includes the capital rtnrk
and bonds aggregating $4.350GC0
of two electric companies rellinq
electrie current in Maine, hut
whose power development Is lo
cated outride the limits cf the
State, one in New Hampshire
ond one in the Province of New
Brunswick. Finallv. in the
amount reported is all the capital
stock and bonds of thee public
service corporations which buy
their power from electric devel
opment companies, but which tio
r>nt develop their own power.
The aggregate capital of there
lait mentioned corp'rat ons
equals several millions of dol
lars.
When the total capital stock
and bonds of the eloctr'c rail
roads, the steam and gas plants
and others mentioned Is deduct
ed from the $62.0C9,OC0 reported
to the Public Utility Commis
sion, there remains but little in
excess of $40,030 000 to represent
the capital stock and bonds cf
all the water power development
companies in the entire State.
Can a more absurd statement
be made concerning the capitali
zation of tho Water Power Com
panies than that quoted in the
parallel column? It implies that
the construction of dams, the ac
quisition of flowage rights, the
transmission lines and the dis
tributing systems of al the load
ing and many of the smaller
hydro electric deve’opment com
panies in the State has cost no
real money.
Again we are constrained to
ask, why do the advocates of
State ownership deem it neces
sary to exaggerate to tnc point of
absurdity ?

PLAN TO EXEMPT
CERTAIN WORKERS
IN SHIPYARDS
Washington, Sept. 17.—Retention by
American shipyards of such employes
as are considered essential to the pro
duction of ships, replacement of those
who will be taken in the new draft and
provision for obtaining 190,000 addition
al workers now needed by the emer
gency fleet corporation, were the sub
jects of a conference today between
Chairman Hurley of the shipping board.
Director General Schwab of the emer
gency fleet corporation, and Provost
Marshal General Crowder. No decision
was reached today and further confer
ences will be held. Shipping board offi
cials around understood take the view
that needs of the shipyards and the
merchant marine at present are entitled
to right of way over the needs of the
army, as without continuation of the
construction program and without unin
terrupted operation of the existing ves
sels even the army now abroad cannot
be supplied.
The views of the war department are
believed to differ in some measure,
though admitting that the construction
and manning of merchant vessels is
necessary to the operation of the army.
Exemption to shipbuilders as a class,
it was said, is not desired, as such ac
tion probably would cause many men
to evade the draft by flocking to the
shipyards.

WHAT ONE FRENCH
GIRL WENT THROUGH
FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY
With the American Army in Lorraine,
Sept. 16.—(By the Associated Press).—
The devotion of a French girl to her
country was recorded last week at one
of the American headquarters. She
made her way through shell fire and
over a region , lied with gas and traps
to bring to the Allies information re
garding tlie Germans. Her name can
not be mentioned.
With her mother and younger brother,
the girl, who ts not yet 2P, had lived at
Soulevre Farm since the day it fell into
the hands of the Germans four years
ago. Four other brothers are in the
French army. Mother, daughter and
“boy were forced to remain within th*
German lines and witness the day by
day conversion of their property into a
German clubhouse. During those four
years mother and daughter endeavored
to placate rather than antagonize their
captors.
From German officers who frequented
the farm the girl learned information
which she recognized to be of great im
portance. When she heard the barrage
Thursday morning she determined to
run the risk of crossing the nearly three
miles separating her home from the al
lied lines.
Telling her mother and the others that
she had work to do in the garden she
left the house. She slipped away toward
the American lines although every' road
wag swept by allied and German gun
fire. After many difficulties and nar
row escapes she reached the American
lines and told her story- In return for
the information she brought she asked
that every effort be made to rescue her
mother and brother. The Germans at
tempted to maintain their position at
Soulevret Farm but the Americans over
came them in desperate fighting. The
mother and the brother were brought to
American headquarters and there was a
Joyful reunion.

PRESIDENT’S ORDER TO
REINSTATE EMPLOYES

cculd be found for them.
A meeting of machinists tonight
men not yet employed should re
turn to work tomorrow under tiie
assumption that the president's or
der nili be complied with.
A new grievance of the machinists j
which probably will be cared for

at the Union Metallic Cartridge !
Company's plant where it is alleged
girls have for the first time been
employed on grinding machines.
Twelve union male operatives have
been displaced from old work but
placed on new and the company haa
refused to remove the girls although
the Union claims the character ofi
the work is neither 'Customary

WASHINGS
FOR BLOWS
ON WESTERN FRONT
Washington. Sept. 2*-Changes in
the battie situation in I rain e
forshadowed by the impen<linfr
ture of St. Quentin and the clearing
of St. Gobain forest, indicatedl by
the unfaltering progress of the Bnt
ish and French armies to be only a
matter of a few days. Both A lied
,md American military officials her
are confident that new blows will
fall Immediately upon the Germans,
ienying them any rest or chance to
■eorganize their battle units: hut
he actual plans of Field Marshal
ire as much of a mystery here as
hey are in Berlin. It now appears
certain that Gen. Pershing’s first
irmy has for the moment complet
'd its alloted task, having blotted
iut the St. Mihiel salient and re
stored to Allied use railways of
ital importance in the future op
rations. In addition is was pointed
>ut today the Americans have re
istablished positions in the vicinity
>f Metz which constitute a direct
hreat at that fortress which the en
?my cannot ignore. As yet, how
ever, there is nothing to indicate
that the American commander has
embarked upon the far reaching
rampaign which would bo necessary
to attempt the capture of this Ger
man stronghold.
For the moment the Allied offens
ive is concentrated on .he Ft. Quen
tin, La Fere and Lnon front. There
is therefore, a strong feeling here
that larger operations which the su
preme commander may contemplate
in the immediate future hinge on
breaking the enemy’s resistance in
tills region and forcing him into u
new retirement. It is When that
movement begins that the moment
for launching a new offensive effort !
will come, in the opinion of many
observers here
There are enormous difficulties to
he found in the breaking of die Ger
man grip on Lorraine by the reduc
tion of Metz it has been pointed out.
It is not possible to regard that city
r;s a single fortress which might be
encircled, and cut off. When the Gel -
mans insisted on including -Metz in
their booty after the Franco-Prus
sign war, they had a very definite
conception of its value, a conception
they have made good in steel and j
s',one. In effect, a whole block of !
country seme .10 square miles ‘n ex
tent and surrounding Metz and
Thionville has been turned into a
vast fortress. Beyond doubt it is
said the position is stronger than
Verdun, against which the German
■army at the top of its power, proved
unavailing. Officials here ft el that
the American people should fully
realize the general strength of this
position and not pin their hopes to
any .swift campaign by Pershing’s |
men for its capture. The thing can i
be done it is said, because, any for- ]
lifted position can he blasted away
by mcdcrii artillery and with the huge
American heavy ordnance program
coming forward to supplement the
French guns, a concentration would
be possible that could sweep away
the hills themselves. But it would
take time and infinite labor, and
theie may be o'her ways of reaching I
the same end in the opinion of Mar- I
shal Foch. 1

AT LUNCHEON SMOKER
In spite of the rain and the small at
tendance at the “luncheon smoker"" hel.i
a the Elks- hall, ftreat enthusiasm was
shown and one of the best speakers
ever heard in the city. Koy S. Smith of
New Vork, was present and delivered a
stirring address in regard to the cham-j
her of commerce. His talk was certain
ly one of the finest ever heard here and i
those who were not present were very!
unfortunate in not hearing the wonder
ful address which dealt not only with
the chamber of commerce but with war
conditions and patriotic lines of work.
Other speakers were Isaac C. Stetson,
president of the First. National hank of
Bangor, and Janies Q. Gulnac, president
of the Bangor Chamber of Commerce.
They pave very interesting accounts of
t' e chamber of commerce endeavors
and told of the old organisation and
what it accomplished before reorganiz
ing and what it has accomplished since
organizing about four months ago.
An fine but simple luncheon was serv
ed to which all did ample justice and
the credit for the repast is due Mrs.
Harry C Ewens, who is in the city with
Mr. Ewens, a member of the American
City Bureau, who are here to reorganize
the local chamber of commerce.
The luncheon was served at 6.30, fol
lowed by instrumental selections by Ar
thur Roundy and singing by the men
present. Cigars ard cigarettes were
passed around and those who indulged
enjoyed their smoke while the program
was carried out.
Harry Brown, president of the local
chamber of commerce, presided at the
meeting in the absence of Dr. Thayer,
who was chairman, and after relating
past experiences of the chamber of com
merce in the. city he .explained how the
money raised at previous campaigns had
been spent and stated that the books
of thr organization are open to any who
care to look at them and learn for
•hemselves just how the money had been
disposed of.
Mr. Brown then introduced the pres
ident of the Bangor Chamber of Com
merce. James Q. Gulnac, who have a ■
short but interesting address about the!
work of ti e organization in Bangor, j
and in his address ptated that the old j
organization was in iupt about the same
circumstances as .be local order, and;
that after four mont is the organization!
had teen rebuilt and that it was pros-!
pering row better than ever before, due,
to the rebuilding of the chamber of 1
commerce by the American City Bureau
people.
He said that although the sum of
5. the joining fee, seemed large,
rat they will bo more than paid
e amount and that the re-building
ould mean a bigger and larger corn
unity and one that every >nan, wo
an and child would be proud to
re in.
The second speaker was Isaac
tetson, president of the National
ank of Bangor and he gave a brief
•count of what the Bangor Cham
•r of Commerce had accomplished
nee re-organizing four months ago.
e said that when the American
ity Bureau came to Bangor that
• thought that the mer. were graft
's, but that he found out different
fter *hay had-been there a few
iyg, and he admitted that they
irned every cent that was paid

SPANISH INFLUENZA
IN 9 ARMY CAMPS
Washington, Sept. 20.—'The outbreak of
Spanish influenza at five additional ar
my training camps was announced to
night by Surgeon General Gorgas, mak
ing a total of nine camps in which the,
disease ha? been discovered.
The total number of cases reported
from camps up to today was 3313, with 1! I
deaths. The greatest number of cases
6513 was reported from Camp Devons,
Mass, while Camp I.ee, \ a., had 1211
and Camp Upton, X. T.. 602. Camp Elev
ens also reported 43 new cases in pneu
monia which medical officers believe re
sulted from the influenza epidemic
87 NEW CASES REPORTED
AT NEW BEDFORD, MASS.
New Bedford, Mass.. Sept. 2n.-Eighty
seven new cases of influenza and one
death were reported to the health au
thorities of this city today. Reports of
only two cases were received yesterday.
Down Counter Blow s
(Continued from Page One)
region during the past few days and
in spite ,ef intense artillery fire,
have succeeded in reorganizing
their new' positions. There is only
about three quarters of a mile of
ground separating the French from
the height on which stand the ruin.s
of Fort Malmaison- It is most dof
ficult ground, however, and excel
lently adapted to the kind of de
fensive fighting the Germans are
carrying on. It is heavily timbered
ami tile broken ground, deep ra
vines and steep slopes make it im
possible for tanks but furnish the
best possible positions for machine
guns which the enemy has assem
bled in great numbers.
It is the plateau of Chauignon the
Germans are defending here so des
perately. More than 430 of their
dead were picked up oyer a space
a ldtlf mile long by a quarter of
a mile deep during the recent fight
ing. The possession of this plateau,
which is the key to the positions
north of the Chemin-Des-Dames,
would compel the enemy to abandon
a part of the St. Golmin forest.
There, can be no hurry in carry
ing out the immense task Gen. Man
gin's men have before them hut they
already have pressed on much too
closely to their goal to permit the
Germans to remain indefinitely on
the defensive.
LOCAL FIGHTING ONLY
BY BRITISH FORCES
""With the British Armies in France,
Sept. 20.—(By the Associated Press)
—Beyond local fighting the Britsh
third and fourth armies northwest of
St. Quentin have not been engaged
today, in the local operations their
netv front had been further improved
at several points. The Gremans are
holding strong machine gun detach
ments in the large number of small
farms, eoppes and sunken roads in
this vicinity but a number of these
have been cleared. In front of .St.
Quentin there were clashes between
the opposing infantry and the British
won some ground east of Holnon vil
lage. The quarries,, covering an area
more than a mile deep and two miles
in width, have been utilized by di
visions of the German second army
for the construction of an under
ground Gibrulter.^ Prussian officials,
including a regimental adjutant, have
been captured. One of the officers
said bets had been freely made that
tlie British would never be aide to
capture the quarries.
While the quarries remained in the
hands of the Germans the enemy ex
pected, with his suplics of ammuni
tion and machine guns to be able to
preevnt the loss of the ridges which
hide the Hinrlenburg main line from
observation. The British treated all
the quarries to a systematic attack
with smoke and shell, with a mixture
of gas in the bargain. At the mo
ment of the attack the smoke was let
loose under the pits. Many of the
occupants of them ran blindly against
the wind, hoping to get free. In do
ing so they ran into the arms of the
English and Australian infantry.
The Prussians who bet on the im
pregnability of the quarries forgot to
take into account the morale of the
troops holding them. Some of the men
fought well even when the Devena and
SulToIks of the 7tth Division dropped
into the pits after exploding smoko
bombs. But many others hid until the
first British wave passed them and then
emerged futilely looking for an escort
to the prisoner cages. Although fighting
of this character invites casualties, the
losses of the Tilii Division were less
than half the usual number of prisoners
taken. The 17th Division has been en
gaged in difficult work south of Guaze
court and also has taken many prison
ers, some of them in hand-to-hand
struggles in the Gauche wood. Its cas
ualties were also far fewer than the
number of prisoners taken.
The troops engaged in the wood hal
to take redoubts fortified with sheet iron
and behind which there were many ma-J
chine guns. Cavalrymen of the <Uh Ger-i
man Division were engaged in the fight
ing near the wood. They were unae- ,
customcd to this form of warfare and :
prisoners of four different cavalry reg
iments were taken by the 17th Division. 1
A British brigadier general left his
groom near a quarry which he sup
posed had been cleared of the Germans;
and went forward tn watch the advance'
of his men. When he returned he found
the perplexed groom surrounded by 4'
armed Germans demanding that the .
groom accept their surrender.

HIGHER FREIGHT RATES
SWELL R. R. EARNINGS
Washington, Sept. 2o.—Railroads in
July showed the best earnings re
corded up to date under government
operation and for th.: first time this
year had more net income than in the
corresponding month of last year.
Operating income amounted to $135.
699,000, or $40,000,000 more than .n
July m T.
This record was caused largely by
the 25 per cent increase in freight
rates. It was apparent r Hat the
rate advance was more than sufficient
to cover th“ higher wages and ocher
increased operating costs. These re
ports, however, did not include the
big sums spent for extensions, bet

capital purposes under the railroad

LEWISTON NUR3E
TELLS SPLENDID
STOR' OF RELIEF
Mrs. Martha Cotton, of Lowell
Street, Mat.. Known Her
Remarkable Experience
Mrs. Martha Cotton, of S8 Low
ell street, Lewiston, probably
is the best known trained n.irse
in this city. She has lived in
Lewiston for 30 years. When a
nurse with the splendid experi
ence of Mrs. Cotton gives an en
dorsement of a medicine, such a
medicine must have extraordi
nary merit. So interesting and
so full of hope to others is Mrs.
Cotton’s state aicnt that it is giv
en in full.
""For a number of years I have
suffered with aliments of the
stomach, liver an i kidneys. Ii
had indigest on so badly 1 could
hardly cat nything and when 1
did eat X would have gas and
bloating so badly that to relieve
myself I would have to remove j
my tighter clothing.
For months I have been living
on cereals, broth and t jast. '
Since taking Flaxolyn my appe
tite is good and I am able to eat
everything. Yesterday 1 ate
surh a big dinner that my folks j
were worried and wondered j
whether I would live the light ]
through. But got up this j
morning feeling just fine.
And just think, only a short i
time ago my liver was in such j
bad condition that my complex- j
ion was not only yellow but1
brown. My kidneys caused j
pains across my back and limbs. !
My feet and hands were bloated I
from poor circulation. I c-.uld !
not sleep and I was so nervous |
at night that the least noise !
would shock rue.
Mrs. Hanna ,'ord of 30 Ash 1
street urged me to try Flaxolyn. !
the new pure herbal medicine 1
that is being introduced. Mrs. |
Hannaford has derived such I
great benefits that I decided to I
try FLAXOLYN and this it}
what has given < such remark- I
able results.
Now my nerves are stronger j
and I sleep well. My nerves,
not being at such a high tension,
I feet strength a.nd ambition re
turning just by lying down i nd
relaxing myself.""
Another Great Rolief
Ar.d now comes another re
ttu. liable feature of Mrs. Cot- i
ton's endorsement.
“About a year and a half ago,"" j
she explained, “a lump formed j
on my left side, just below the ;
heart. Some physicians said it |
was a fatty tumor and I would \
have to have an operation. Oth- I
ers said I had gall stones and
acute indigestion. This enlarge
ment. with my bad liver, stom
ach and kidneys, was actually
eating my life away.
Before I had finished the first
box of FLAXOLYN I was sur
prised to see this lump gi fting i
smaller. Now it has entirely i
'Ns ppeared. It loft me so rap- j
idly I could hardly wait for the j
days to pass t-> see it getting!
actually smal’ r. J
Knew the Effects
I cannot praise FL.AXOi.YN
too highly My folks and
friends, in fact everybody, who
sees mo remark •• about the
change in my looks and com
plexion. After taking Flaxolyn
a couple of days L got deathly
sick at the stomach and had diz
zy spells, but know'ng the piop
erttes of the Nature ingredients
in Flaxolyn and how badly my
system needed cleansing. 1 did
not hesitate to continue Flaxo
lyn because 1 knew it was just
getting in its work.”
OUR GUARANTEE
Wc guarantee that Flax
oivn will give you relief.
If it does not, and you are
the sole judge, or if it is
in any way unsatisfactory,
your money will be given
back to you without ques
tion or quibble.
FLAXOLYN, Inc.
CCULD EAT NO SOLID FOOD
FLAXOLYN CURED HIM
‘Let me have three more
boxes of FLAXOLYN, ns it has
done wonders for me, said Mr.
C. . Jennings of Id 1’ark street,
Lewiston. The last three boxes
l got, I gave t a’o of them away
to travelling men who were
friends of mine and were trou
bled with their stomachs and
livers,” Mr. Jennings explained.
""I am a travelling man myself
and have seen and heard of so
many medicines containing
stimulants and dope tiiat 1 have
been mighty careful whai. 1
tried. I first learned <>f Flaxo
lyn, your pure nat. re remedy of
roo s and herbs, from a friend in
Bangor who was taking it and
getting such good results.
Through eating different kinds
of foods and copking I got my
stomach and bowels in bad con
dition years ago. and for months
I had been living on toast, -'ggs
and cereals. If I ate any kind of
sol 1 food, gas would form and
I would have such bad attacks
that I would lose consciousness.
I had pains all through my body
but it was worse around my
heart. I always carried soda
mint tablets to relieve the gas
and strychnine tablets to stim
ulate my heart after one of these
bail attacks
Besides this. T always had to
take cathartics for my liver and
bowels. My nerves were in ter
rible shape from lack of sleep.
My wife said when 1 was home
1 always carried - chip on my
•shoulder, so 1 must have been a
regular grouch.
But thanks to FLAXOLYN, I
am my old self again. I have a
good appetite and can eat every
thing without any bad effect"". I i
sleep better, my nerves arc more !
quiet and my bowels have be- ;
come regular. |
This is what FLAXOLYN has
done for me and I am not sur
prised that so many people are
talking: about it. 1 know i have
personally recommended Plato,
•yn to at least a dozen people.”
DIDN'T THINK THERE
COULD BE A RLMEDY
SO GOOD AND SAFE
: Happy Portland Woman So
Quickly Relieved I y Flaxolyn
I She is Astonished
""I did not think there eouiil bp
. .1 remedy ns good, and :mfe and
! natural ns is FLAXOLYN. I
j had suffered from stomach trcu
! 'do and nervousness for so many
years that I had about decided
there was no relief for me.”
This is how Mrs. .Tames fT
Gulliver of Sn Bren.wood street,
Portland, began a remarkable
statement about FLAXOLYN,
; Dr. Luntz' Nature medicine.
""Mv appetite was just miser
able and after forcing myself to
eat in trying to keep up my
strength. I would be most
wretched. The undigested food
would cause gas. bloating, pain
and a dull heavy feeling that
showed m<- how run down I teas.
My nerves were all on edge. The
slightest exertion would make
my heart beat like a trap ham
mer.
I slept badly and T would get
up in the morning all tired and
achy, with a bad taste In my
mouth and feeling terribly bil
ious and weakened. y tried
many remedies. T got tempor
ary relief from one. but it con
tained alcohol and I soon had t>
stop It because it did not agree
with me. Besides. I am opposed
to alcohol from a moral stand
point.
I had about decided that T wvs
never to get relief when t*
learned about FLAXOLYN.
When 1 rend about the pure Na
1 ture ingredients in FLAXOLYN
and saw It had no alcohol u
drugs, 1 thong’ . that it would ho
the remedy for me and I bought
a box.
The biliousness, bad taste and
I weakne.ss ended almost at once.
My appetite and sleep came
back and 1 am feeling better
than I have for years. It is
only a short time since J learned
of Flaxolyn and realized it was
just what I needed because i
could understand it and knew
; the ingredients should do just
what was claimed for them.'
""Mrs. Gulliver suffered from
the common form of stomach,
liver and intestinal trouble that
is caused by auto-intoxication,”
said Dr. Luntz. ""Of course, .-die
realized Flaxolyn was what, she
needed because everyone quick
ly understands what the Xa.uro
remedies they have known about
since childhood will do. They
know that herbs, fruits, roots,
barks and seeds have great spe
cial curative powers, and that
when combined and neutralized
they will cleanse and purify the
whole digestive tract and so
make more strength, pure blood
and vigorous nerve force.

BUSINESS men
HEAR WILSON AT
NOON SMOKE TALK
About 16 of the business men in
the city met Saturday noon at the
Elmwood hotel for a luncheon and
smoke talk, and much enthusiasm
was shown when the question rf the
reorganizing of the Chamber of Com
merce was brought up and discussed
by Lucius E. Wilson of New York
City, who was the speaker at the
mass meeting last Friday evening.
Mr. Wilson is a most able speaker
and certainly btought out the facts
“why WatervlUe should have a
Chamber of Commerce at this time ”
He thoroughly discussed the subject
anti after he finished hit addresa a
few minutes which were left were
passed in answering and discussing
questions which were asked by the
members prpsent.
Harry Brown, president of the pres
ent Chamber of Commerce in the
city, presided and after the luncheon
made a few remarks, after which
he introduced the speaker, L. E.
Wilson, who said: “Gentlemen, any
American who cannot look pleasantly
today has some thing wrong with
them. I am regretful that we have
eo little time left to talk about this
important subject of the Chamber of
Commerce. The man who says that
the movement now ust land where
I your money has landed in years be
| fore when the Chamber of Commerce
I was being reorganized, does not
: know what he is talking about. There
; are certain things in the reorganiz
! ing that you must do, and In the long
1 run you will have to come across^, if
not at present. Why it will be in a
very short time, because a Chamber
of Commerce is a necessity and must
be organized in every city and town.
You men of WatervlUe have the
chance today to make use of tho
things of the past and this is a good
opportunity.”
He referred to the Chamber of
Commerce in citits the size of Wt
terville, and told how they were pros
pering and of what a great necessity
this organization is to a community.
He said that the membership t-e of
$25 a year for dues was all the ex
pense, and that at the opening of the
organization it is necessary to have
the dues paid on the three-year bas
is, in order to have the required funds
to worl* with.
""There are certain things you will
have to have if this is oVganized.
First, you will have to have the three
years subscription dues paid, artd af
ter that the dues will be $25.00 a
year. A three year pledge if ftbsoT
lutcly essential. You have had no<
programs in the past but now you
will have one, and the program will
be laid out for the work of each com*
mittee of the organization. Those
qualities are enough to guarantee the
Chamber of Commerce to any city.
1 The new organization is organized
with the same men. but will be cat
rled on on a different scale. If this
is not the time for the reorganizing
of an organization of this kind, I
think that President Wilson ought to
be notified and have it brought to a
stop, but he approves of it as well as
others who are boosting the cam
paign every day.
WatervlUe has got to have some
kind of leadership, with the thinking
I man of the town. A town either
I knows where it is going or doesn’t.
There are some men who say that
this is all a bunk and that there will
never be an outcome. Sitting still is
the easiest thing that a human being
ever does, and the most profitless
thing in the world to himself and to
his community.”
Mr. Wilson referred to the Chamber
of Commerce organization In other
cities and states. “If this Chamber
of Commerce Is the wrong thing,"" he
asked “why some of you people of
WatervlUe should go to those cities
who already have the organization
and tell them a few things.” He said
that since the first of January there
had been over 20 different cities and
towns organized as chamber of com
merce or reorganized by the same
men that were here in the c ity from
the American City Bureau, anfi tfcal
they still had several more townli and
cities on their lists to visit and in
which to start similar campaigns.
“Some of you people think that
when you have nothing else to do
that you will give this some of your
time and attention. We have come
to the point that if you can prove by

COLBY COLLEGE
Things are moving very rapidly
at the college for a practically special
►course, and is to be divided in three
divisions; academic division which is
as It used to be; the women’s divis
ion dractjcally the same as before,
and in addition to the college is the
Student's Army Training Course, un
der the division* of several special
men from the United States army.
The campus is beginning to look
natural with the boys returning, but
it also notices that the boys are
younger than years before, due to the
effect of the selective draft.
The gymnasium is being made over
into a mess hall and under the sup*
ervision of grounds Fred Short, who
had a crew working in the gym clean
ing the floor and making the plffiee
immaculate. The ceilings and wails
have been cleaned and whitewashed
and abont four feet of the walls will
be painted with a brown border. Tbe
locker rooms have been changed into
a kitchen and a large hotel fange has
been installed. A t refrigerator has
been installed and is already stocked
with supplies ready to begin business
on Tuesday when the school will
open for the fall term.
Long tables will be provided which
will be lined wjth newly constructed
benches for the cadet* to sit on. Be
tween the former locker rooms and
the gym and a large serving slide has
been made. The gym looks natural
and yet very unnatural and in some
respects would hardly be recognized
by an older graduate from the college.
Other changes will be made. The of
fice of the college treasurer will be mov
ed from the Savings Bank building to
the northwest corner room of the ground
floor of thgmcitation hall, which used to
be used aS% trophy room and for meet
ings of the athletic council. This room
will 'b«:Jflivided UP so that there is a
sort oUanteroom and a room for stor
age in addition to the large offices whicn
will be occupied by Frank B. Hubbard,
acting treasurer of the college.
The dormitory will be turned into bar
racks and the suites of rooms formerly
occupied by two will now accommodate
four cadets. *
The dormitory should be able to ac
commodate from TO to SO cadets and
possibly more.
The commanding officers of the S. A.
T. C. have been using as an administra
tion office the room in the chemical hat!
across the hall from President Roberts’
office.
It is understood around the campus
that the officers detailed to the S. A. T.
C. will have quarters on the campus
of Hedman hall.
»Jt .is also understood that the stu
dehts will be held under rather close
supervision, messing together in the
gym, occupying’the dormitories as bar
racks and studying in a large room un
der th^ supervision of an officer rather
than independently and individually as
as the usual»custom at college.

his college course.
A notice has been posted on the
campus announcing a big get-to
gether meeting at the former A. T. O.
house at Colby which will take place
Monday evening when all the stu
dents at Colby will meet, giving the
old and new students the opportunity
of meeting and getting acquainted
and to find out Who’s Who in college
this year.
The embryo members of the Colby
S. T. A. are getting a little taste of
military discipline already. Whilst
they are being registered and are set
tling thwnselves they are required to
report every two hours qf the dny.
This will be some hardship for some
of the young men who are accus
tomed to coming and going as they
like at home. And when they wake
up at the sound of a bugle they will
be grieved that they cannot shut off
the bugle as easily as the clock in
the old days when they put the clock
under the bed clothes or slung It out
of the window.

Belgium in 1314 has been restored to
Belgian ownership through the ef
forts of the mixed Belgian and Brit

allied forces had captured Dixmude

important junction town of Roulers*
To the south from the region east of
Arras to St. Quentin the British, witn
the Americans fighting on their right,
everywhere have penetrated the German
defences over the 35 mile front. Desper
ate resistance was offered by the Ger
mans, but the alli«M troops' refused to be
denied and swept through the remaining
portions of the Hindenburg line and are
now in the outskirts of Cambrai. More
than 18,000 prisoners have been taken In
this region since Friday.
Under the efforts of the British,
Americans and French, the Germans
have been cleared out of the entire de
partment of the Somme, and part of the
department of the Ardennes now is in
French hands for the first time since
1911.

GERMAN PAPERS
Admit the Situation Is
Serious
Ask People to Remain Calm in Face
of Bulgarian Defection—Believe
Nation Will Show Itself Capable
of Meeting New Contingency
Copenhagen, Saturday, Sept. 28—
All the German papers, according to
a special dispatch from Berlin, are
united in warning their readers to
remain calm in the face of the un
settled Bulgarian situation. They ad
mit that the situation is serious but
declare that the German nation will
show itself capable of meeting this
new contingency.
George Bernhard, in the Vossischc
Zeitung declares that ""It is necessary
that the chancellor, who no longer
possesses the confidence of millions
of German men. must leave office.""
He asserts that the happenings in
Bulgaria could not have come as a
complete surprise to the leadern of
German policy. He believes that they
were,' at least, aware of the feeling
; prevailing in Bulgaria for the last
| few months.
Vorwaerts, the organ' of -the ma
i jority socialists, asks its readers to
consider the situation if Germany
| were left alone with her ba*ck against
the wall, fighting all the Allies. The
paper draws n graphic picture of de
. frat. with .thousands dying of hunger
and the ian<i and people enslaved.
It closes by an appeal to every Ger
man to stand fast.

Americans Gain Local
Success in Verdun Sector
With the American army north
war,t of Verdun, Oct. 7.—(By The
Associated Press).—The Americans
achieved another important though
local • success today by forcing the
Germans out of Chatel Chehry. north- '
west of Apremont. Pushing forward !
they overcome the stubborn resist-!
ance of the enemy and settled them- |
selves on the commanding Heights i
west of the river Aixe.
Nothing of importance occurred on ;
the other portions of the American 1
front throughout today.
The troops in the center of the at- i
•tack met the first obstacle 10 minutes 1
after starting in the shape of Ger- '
man trenches. The Americans del- j
uged them with hand grenades car
rying the entrenchments. They ri ach
ed their first objective in record time
and entered Chatel Chehry at S.40
o’clock with only slight resistance.
An attack on Hill 244, where the Ger
mans occupied strong posts was be
gun at once and there was desperate
fighting as the Americans stormed
the heights.
In the meantime other infantry de
tachments filtered through in single
file into Abde wood and helped to
carry Hill 244, which was taken be
fore noon. The troops reached the
north side of the hill by 1 o’clock in
the afternoon while others advancing
over the Chenetondu ridge reached
and passed I-a Viergette.
The enemy retired before this ad
vance and the victory was complete
at .1 o’clock. The line* at <’haiel
Chehry were strongly consolidated;
and patrols began roconnoit-rlng
ahead, meeting with little opposition.
The German artillery fire on the right
—grown quieter than on any previ
ous day. The extreme right, which
has been bombarded from some
change in its direction to further
north. Great northern and northeast
ern movements of artillery have been i
noted above Cunel.
The machine gun fire likewise
notably decreased on the center cast :
of the American line. This was es- j
pecially true of Cunel wods which has :
been a veritable hive of machine guns j
but these wer quiet today.
, The Germans delivered a local at
tack In Champagne at daylight east
of St. Etienne. They received a
counter thrust at the hands of the
Americans which those who lived to
tell the tale will long remember. |
The Americans had advance lnfor- i
mation of a ponding German attack '
and they more than met the Germans :
half way. When the German artil- j
lery opened the Americans were i
ready and sent Into the new line five 1
or more shells for every German pro
jectile hurled at them. Among the I
prisoners taken were 17 bewildered i
pioneers from the Hhelma lector, who j
were serving as infantrymen for the j
first time. As the German artillery
opened along the line from St.
Etienne to Orfeut several companies
of German Infantry started filtering
through the shaggy patches of pine
woods. Most of them were seasoned
troops. The French and American
artillery however, was so effective
that their veterans were thrown Into
confusion. Many of them were killed.
The seventeen pioneers were cut off
from the other Germans by Amer
ican machine gun fire and made pris
oner. Six of them were wounded.

ported as feeling deeply that the Fourth

The Cumberland County Power &

filed a revision of the schedule which
went into effect last July after a full in
vestigation made by the Public Utili
ties Commission, Attorney General Guy
H. Sturgis and the company. As a re
sult of that investigation an agreement
was reached as to a schedule of rates.
Among other things arranged was that
upon the three so called city lines the
5-cent fare should be retained and 6
cents charged as thj tnttial fare on all
other lines. These three city lines are
locally known as Union Station, Mun
jo.v Hill. Union Station-Grand Trunk
Depot and Spring street. The company
proposes to make the fare on these three
lines 6 cents. Any change is to give a
transfer from the city to all other lines
whereas now one cent is charged for
each such transfer The new rates will
bs effective Xov. 7. The matter of an
investigation by the Public Utilities
Commission as tb the proposed increase
in fares will be taken up later when the
health conditions are better.
Tha Influenza Epidemic
Major Bial F. Bradbury, medical aid
to the Governor, who is in charge of the
situation in Maine regarding the sup
plying of physicians and nurses for
thosa places afflicted with the influenza
! stated late Wednesday afternoon that
reports received by him indicated that
in the southern part of the State the
epidemic appeared to be abating a lit
tle. It is slowly but surely spreading
throughout the rest of the State and It
is expected thru the entire area will be
infected brfore the disease disappears.
The fine wlather conditions of the past
two days has aided materially in caus
ing hope 'or a betterment in the situa
tion at an early date.
Major Bradbury is having consider
able trouble in securing the necessary
number of nurses. When Massachu
setts was first afflicted, the authorities
there had a complete list of our Maine
nurses and they were sent for post haste,
so vhat when our turn with the afflic
tion came, we were left without enough
nurses. All the male and female nurses
obtainable are being secured and locat
ed in the most effectual positions as
district nurses, from which that action
can be as advantageously handfed as
possible. No attempt—because it would
be impossible—is being made to supply
nurses for individual cases or families.
Dr. Leverett IJ. Bristol, the State
commissioner of health, Wednesday 1
night stated that he could not say that i
the Spanish Influenza epidemic was
abating, but that he hoped that a
change for the better would come soon.
Dr. Thomas S. Blair of the United
States Public Health Service went
Wednesday to,Eastport and Lubec to
assist in organizing in those communi
ties to combat the disease which is
raging quite strongly in those places.
Physical Examinations
Adjutant General George McL,. Pres
son, the provost marshal of Maine,
Wednesday sent out a bulletin to the
various exemption boards in relation to
physical examinations as follows::
■'Several local boards have inquired
whether physical examinations should
he continued notwithstanding the preva
lent epidemic of influenza tow hich wo
have replied as follows:
“Urgent need of available men neces
sitates continuance of physical exami
nations. Would suggest that men be
called in groups of not more than 15 at
stated intervals during the day. Calls
should be issued for men to report at
such hours daily as will not assemble
another group until the examination of
the preceding group is completed.""
State House Chat
Meeting of the Governor and Council
at 10 o clock this (Thursday) morning.
The program is expected to be confined !
largely to routine matters, although
the confirmation is in order of the nomi
nation of Frank L. Dutton of Augusta
as chairman of the Industrial Accidents
Commission. ■ ice Eben F. Littlefield of
Belfast, term expired.
Governor Milliken was engaged
Wednesday afternoon in harvesting the
crop at his .iome on Western avenue,
picking apples, etc. It is understood,
however, that the children of the Gov
ernor's family had a monopoly on the
picking up potatoes industry, for which
they received five cents a bushel. They
hustled too, for the crop was about 75
bushels.
Assistant Attorney General Franklin
Fisher is reported ill with pneumonia at
his home in this city.
Chairman Eben F. Littlefield is also
reported ill with the influenza at his
home in this city.
George W. Leadbetter is reported re

BEAUTIES OF
OLD JERICHO
Jerusalem, Sept. 9.—Allied soldiers
in the valley of the Jordan know now
how really unkind were persons who,
in pre-war days, “wished them in
Jericho.” To these fighting men,
Jericho and its dust-covered environs
meat heat, flies, mosquitoes and
snakes, mildly advertised by the
Turks in this message set tip opposite
the British lines: “Don’t fear an of
fensive from us; we will come over
later when you are all dead.”
This summer, day after day, army
thermometers along the Jordan regis
tered from 105 to 125. Yet with
scarcely a breeze, and these dust
laden. the Australian' and New Zea
land horsemen holding these lines,
bringing from a temperate climate a
reserve of health and vigor lacking in
the natives, withstood the ordeal. It
is the second or third summer that
tells.
The flies and mosquitoes of the
valley know no pity. In the early
days of the fighting, when it was im
possible to take the necessary sani
tary precautions, they bred in
myriads, but now- pools of stagnant
water have been eliminated and large
tracts of scrub burned. As a result,
the number of malaria cases has been
surprisingly low.
Of the minor evils, the snakes are
the worst, hut due to the precautions
taken by officers and men, casualties
from snake-bites have been com
paratively insignificant, despite the
number of the repfllesf and their
venomous species.
One captured Turk had been at
tacked and bitten by a serpent four
feet long, and as he lay on his cot in
a British hospital, he told how he
strangled the reptile and then fanted.
His nerve were shattered by the in
cident, and medical officers said it •
would be years before they were*
again normal.

went to Bath to work in a ship yard.
He was taken ill with the prevailing
epidemic and came home Saturday,
Sept. 2S. His disease developed into
pneumonia and all that could be done
by.loving hands failed to stand off
the grim reaper. It was not his part

DANGEROUS DRUGS.
LATE FALL PLOWING
AND INSECT CONTROL
It Will Kill Thousands
of the Wireworms
Orono, Me., Oct. 9.—The following
was issued today from the office of
Charles D. Woods, director of the
Maine Agricultural Experiment sta
tion at the University of Maine:
The Maine Agricultural Experi
ment Station frequently has occasion
to advise cultivators to start the
preparation of their seed-bed in the
fall of the year and this would seem
an appropriate time to point out some
of the advantages of ""late fall plow
ing.”
""Kate fall plowing” seems to work
in better on many Maine farms than
early fall or late summer fallowing
and in some respects it is advantage
ous, especially from the standpoint of
insect control. It is a well known
fact that insects become sluggish as
the cold comes on and many of them
crawl into the ground to hibernate.
Others, such as wireworms. white
grubs, cutworms, and many others
which live in the ground curl up and
pass the winter in a quiescent con
dition. Now when these are turned
up by the plow and exposed to the
weather they arc often too sluggish
to crawl back into the ground and are
easily captured by their natural ene
mies. Where ""wireworms” have been
especially numerous ""late fall plow
ing” will destroy great numbers by
exposing them to the birds, skunks
and the tiny moles and field shrews.
The mole depends entirely upon in
sects for l>is food and wireworms
constitute a large part of his diet es
pecially in the meadows and corn
land. Kali plowing always helps our ,
animal friends by breaking the sod
and making the underground inects
available to them but it also has an
immediate ..value in destroying the
wireworm adults. When wireworms
“change over” to adults or “click
beetles” they construct a little earth
en cell in which the process occurs
and then the soft beetle remains over
winter in the cell. If, now, the cell is
broken open by plowing, the beetle
will be killed and will lay no eggs in
the adjacent meadow land. Beside
the many ground inhabiting insects
thus destroyed their eggs are fre
quently broken and turned up to the
Weather and great numbers such as
grasshopper egg packets are entirely
prevented from hatching.
In case the soil is known to be in
fested with* wireworms and trouble
was experienced this year in grow
ing corn, for instance, the cultivator
often wonders what crop he may plant
in such land. Oats, barley, rye,
buckwheat, clover and other similar
small grains and field crops seem to
suffer less and are always included in
the same rotation system with corn.
In the same way, when meadow land
is plowed up trouble may be avoided
if wireworms are abundant by plant
ing to one of the smalj grains fol
lowed by clover and corn when less
injury will be observed. Complete
eradication of wire-worms is almost
impossible but the numbers are re
duced to a minimum by crop rota
tion.
Beside the advantages of insect
contbol, weeds are destroyed and the
furrow-slice is given time to settle
down against the subsoil and to es
tablish good capillary connections for
moisture. Small grains thrive, better
on a fairly compact seed-bed which
fall plowing establishes so well. Fall
plowing also relieves the spring rush
at seeding time and helps solve the !
labor shortage problem occurring at
that time. And, after all the climate l

WHAT IS A HOSTESS HOUSE?
HOSTESS HOUSE, DIAMOND ISLAND, MAINE
Bulletin boards in many camps
now display this sign, at the head of
a paragraph of explanation, since it
has been found that many of the en
listed men of the camps do not know
that the Young Women’s Christian
Association Hostess Houses are in
tended as social centers for men as
well as women.
A Hostess House is situated just
outside a camp or cantonment and is
a place for the mothers, sisters and
sweethearts to meet the soldier and
sailor boys. It is a place where the
boys feel at home and always find a
welcome.
Miss Julia E. Noyes, hostess at the
Cape Elizabeth Hostess House, re
ceived a card the other day which
rend: ""l have been sent away for a
few days but will be ‘home’ soon.”
This is one of many instances which
show what the Hostess Houses mean
to the boys.
Most of “those homes"" have a li- j
brary, reception rooms, an informa- j
tion department, and a cafeteria, all
of which are very popular.
“One of the boys, talking to one of ;
the War Workers, said that he had |
the best time that Sunday at the Y. 1
W. C. A. that he had had since he j
came to camp, and he had been there !
a year. He said: “I don’t go to town
any more, for 1 don’t know anyone
and I have no place to go. and X get
tired of walking up and dotvn the
streets. Now I am coming every !
Sunday and bring the other fellows I
know.”
compels us to pulverize the seed-bed
well in the spring and to give the
plants an early start.

Christmas Packages For Over-Seas
Those intending to send Chrustmas
packages to thj boys in France should
cut out the following complete instruc
tions as they wi'l not appear in these
columns again. Read carefully the fol
lowing:
Send name of relative or friend over
seas to whom you wish to send Christ
mas boxes at once to Mrs. Charles H.
Graj*, chairman of Gardiner Red Cross
Chapter. Do it now. Every man abroad
will receive a Christmas label with in
structions to mail this label home to
relative or friend.
When you get this label apply to the
nearest headquarters of the Red Cross,
which in Gardiner is at Room 3 at tffe
postoflice, and upon presentation of la
bel you will receive one (1) carton.
Pack your carton and take it to the
American Red Cross headquarters,
whose representative will examine the
contents in order to exclude any article
barred by the postoflice department
from Christmas packages; remove notes
or messages from among the contents;
wrap, tie and weigh parcel (weight of
parcel must not exceed three pounds);
place on the parcel the Christmas label
received from abroad with correct .-.d
dress of the man for whom intended.
Persons sending the parcel shall then,
in the presence of the Red Cross repre
sentative, affix stamps sufficient to car
ry the parcel to Hoboken, N. J.
Lastly, the -:ed Cross inspection lebai
certifying to the complete inspection by
the Red Cross shall be placed on the
parcel. Now, remember this: No Christ
mas parcel can be mailed later than
November 13.
City Council Meeting
A petition signed by Maurice W.
Royal and some twenty-three or
twenty-four others asking for the
construction of a sidewalk on Clin
ton street, was received and dis
cussed. It seems that a similar pe
tition was received last year and
a walk laid as requested. The peti
tion received on Mondaw evening is
evidently a continuation of the same.
After discussion the matter was re
ferred to Alderman Koss of the street
department.
Hon. Charles A. Knight appeared
before the council in behalf of the
Amesbury-Twombly Co. Mr. Knight
stated that the cellar -of the above
named concern was wet and at times
considerable water stood therein.
This condition he claimed was due
to the caving in of one of the city
sewers on Water street. Inasmuch
as the matter had been brought to
the attention of the council before
and the matter remained the same,
Mr. Knight asked that immediate ac
tion be taken. Alderman Russ stat
ed that he had already made arrange
ments for a man to undertake the
work and that it would probably be
begun forthwith. Routine business
occupied the balance of the session.
Edwin \V. Ellis has purchased of
E. C. Bowler the house numbered 53
Dresden avenue. It is understood
that he buys for occupancy.

Hallowcll, whose professional fame
was more than state-wide. From
her father she inherited a strong
mentality, sound judgment and good
common sense. These traits devel
oped by a thorough education made
her a power for good and Capable of
filling the :iigh position seh so richly
adorned. One evidence of this was
the high estimate of her opinions en
tertained by even scholarly men oc
cupying high positions in our fore
most institutions of learning. Add
ed to this superior intellectual en
dowment there was a tender, gener

of an opportunity for a kind, unsel

Mrs. Curtis’ loyalty to friends and

Dear Mother:
Have nothing much to do this
morning so thought I would drop you
just a line. Everything is going fine
and I am gaining weight every day.
Somehow I have a wonderful appe
tite since I have been here. Would
you believe me, I had a nice shave
this morning with real hot water and
for breakfast I had six slices of
good white bread, bacon, jam, fried
potatoes and coffee. I maintain that
was some breakfast. The weather is
the most disagreeable thing over
here as it rains most of the time, but
I have a nice pair of hip rubber boots
and a good rain coat, so I should wor
ry. In most cases we are better
fired than the folks back home in the
way of clofhes and eats. We have a
fine location for an office—there is
a pig pen and a chicken roost the
next door to us—but just the same it
is a wonderful little cozy office.
There are not many Franch people
around the town, only very old men
and women and they keep pretty
much to themselves. They have
built some good roads through the
country, most of them lined with a
straight row of trees on either side
of the road, which makes it very pic
turesque* There are some very
pretty little towns over here. I have
seen such views in moving pictures
but really didn't know how to appre
ciate them until now. There isn’t
much more to say only that I am well
and happy. Love to all,

BIG SCRAP ON
BETWEEN LENINE
AND TROTZKY
London, Oct. 14.—News emanating
from Berlin says a great conflict has
arisen between the Russian premier,
Lenine, and Foreign Minister Trotaky,
according to a dispatch from Copenha
gen to the Exchange Telegraph Co. Pre
mier Lenine is accusing Trotzky of sup
porting a counter revolution. No direct
news has been heard from Moscow for
; two days.
NO ARMISTICE
(Continued from Page One)
the details of the downfall of the
German autocratic government might
be arranged lated. But this is what
an armistice would entail:
First—A stop to the atrocities on land
and sea and the systematic destruction
and devastation in the wake of the re
treating German armies. Then the dis
armament of ell the German forces an 1
the depots of their arms and munitions
at points to be chosen by the Allied mil
itary cammonders. Then the occupa
tion by Allied forces of certain German
cities or strongholds of strategic im
portance. Probably also the occupation
of all the submarine bases, a turrrng
over of the German fleet.
In short, it would entail a taking from
Germany of e-erything with which sae
might break her word to an armistice.
* rom that point the United Stat. s
and the Allien might proceed to dispose
of what remained of Kaiserism if the
German people have not done it before,
as President Wilson in his note plainly
invites them to do.
While nowhere in the note does the.
President openly join with the Entente
statesmen in the demand that the ""cr.iel
criminals ’ must be delivered up for
trial, the President’s confidants po-st
out that he plainly subscribes to the
doctrine that the guilt of bringing on the
world war is personal.
It will be noted that the President
completely rejects the German sugges
tion for a mixed commission to arrange
an evacuation and reminds the militar
ists that they will accept the terms laid
down by Marshal Foch and the associ
ated commanders in that they will have
no part in framing the*.. He makes it
plain that he does not accept the new
German government headed by Chance'
lor Maximilian as anything less auto
cratic, anything less a creature of Ger
man militarism than its predecessor,
and warns the German people unless
they destroy it the Allied armies will
do so.
ARMISTICE MUST
COME THROUGH
MILITARY HEAD
Washington, Oct. 14.—Any cessation of
hostilities will be through the com
manding general in the field. Senator
Ashhurst of Arizona told the Senate to
day after a conference with President
Wilson at the White House. ""Woodrow
Wilson is not going to have any armis
tice of his own making,"" said the sen
ator. He also gave notice that autocra
cy must go before final peace can come.
PRESIDENT CHEERED
BY THOUSANDS ON
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
Washington. Oct. 14,-While President
Wilson's decision on Germany's note
was being prepared for announcement
at the White House and the state de
partment, the President went down
town on a shopping trip. He drove to a
jewelry store in one of the White House

motors Due wanted dick up x'cnusyivs*
nia avenue to the White House. Penn
sylvania avenue was black at the ti.ne
with crowds of war workers just out of
offices. A great crowd surrounded the
shop in which the President was : nJ
when he appeared hi was greeted with
roars of cheers. Acknowledging the
greetings, Wilson abandoned the
r.otor and strode off up the avenue,
walking alone and with secret service
men to the side and behind.
Washington has gotten pretty used to
seeing the President on the streets, but
his appearance today when the world
has its eyes mcussed upon him lent a
touch of the dramatic to the inciden.
The President wore a brown business
suit, a brown soft hat and carried a ,
walking stick. He was kept continually 1
smiling and acknowledging greetings as
he went alonj carrying a small pak
age, evidently the contents of his pur
chase.
PRESS COMMENT ON
PRESIDENT’S ANSWER
Portland (Me.) Daily Eastern Argus—
It is a definite indictment of the pres
ent German government, charging them
with illegality and inhumanity, guilty
of crimes heretofore unbelievable, anil
an expression of determination to utter
: ly crush so foul a thing as autocracy
i has proven itself to be, a declaration
| that the world shall be made safe, no
matter what sacrifice may be necessary
to accomplish this end.”
Portland (Me.) Press—The President’s
j note measures up to the demands and
| expectations of the American people and
| will meet their endorsement and ap
1 proval. It ends discussion. If Uermany
| wants peace now it Knows how it may
j obtain it and may proceed to act. The
| President's previous note was open to
doubtful interpretation and for th»j rea
i son was a disappointment and met with
; no more than perfunctory approval both
at home and abroad. No such criticism
can be offered of his last."" •
The Lowell (Mass.) Courier Citizen
will say tomorrow: The President has
answered as properly as he has prompt
ly. The instant denial of Germany's
request is justified by Germany's per
! sistent barbarity in the interim. The
j persistence of absolute imperial power
makes a lie of her claim to have a com
j I>lete list of the President's terms. The
i war must go on unless Germany by
I downright surrender gives those ’abso
| lutely satisfactory guarantees of milita
ry supremacy” of which the President
1 speaks. Other guarantee than surren
1 der there is none.
I Boston Herald:—The reply of the
! President is made remarkable by its
i very inconclusiveness. The unani
mous out cry of his countrymen
j forces him to reassure them of the
1 military situation. But he fails to
, make the utmost of his opportunity.
: feo far as the answer goes, we are
| back again in the right direction.
I But it is not the utterance of a man
I of action. There may be still other
: notes before us. The country still
I waits to hear the clarion tall which
, tbe gravity of the hour and the great
| ness of the issue demand.
Boston Post:—President Wilson
makes a notably and significantly
prompt and effective reply. There is
no escaping the iron logic of his
words. It is recognized as a call for
unconditional surrender.
New York Tribune:—Why. in our
growing correspondence with Ger
many, is the word surrender tabooed?
Why is it that we cannot talk as we
fight? We are negotiating with
Germany towards an armistice—
toward peace. Does the American
government know' the heart of the
American people and how it sinks as
each further expectation is so vague
ly disappoionted?
Now York World:—The President
at one stroke has swept away this
whole German structure of a paper
peace without guarantees.
Louisville Courier-Journal: —Again
the President has spoken with the
voice of America and for the civil
ized nations of the earth. The an
swer of the President is an ultimatum
to a defeated power. Its terms are
clear that only two courses lie open
to the Germans—submission, which
means present surrender, or resist
cnce, which means ultimate destruc
tion.
Springfield. Mass., Republican: —
The salient, the supreme feature of
the President's reply is the blow now
openly and directly struck at Kaiser
ism.
New York Times—An American
pen has forever stilled the rattling
of that terrible German sabre. This
swash-buckling emperor has brought
down upon himself the wrath of
certain other instruments of the Lord
I w'ho have amply prepared themselves
I to make his remaining way short
and its end exemplary. The Presl
j dent has spoken a word of command,
i not counsel.
I Springfield (Mass.) Union: The Presi
dent’s reply to the German government
lacks two words that have an important
j place in American history and are at
i present very much in the vocabulary cf
j the American people. The absence of
i these two words means, in all proba
■ bility, further correspondence, which
will be ended only when the President
bluntly and curtly says: ""Our terms are
unconditional surrender.”
Boston Globe: It is “Down with the
Kaiser” or ""On t? Berlin.”
Chicago Tribune: The President's re
sponse to the German proposals rises
inevitably from the logic of the dd'.j
worthy communications and addresses
which have marked our controversy
with the imperial German government.
It expresses with force and unequivo
cally the connection and purpose of the
American people in this war and will re
ceive their unhesitating and undivided
and enthusiastic approval.
St. Louis Globe Democrat: The Pres
I ident has not misinterpreted the spirit
of the nation in his reply.
Salt Lake City Tribune: The President
has once more done the right thing at
the right time.
New York Herald: If the German mil
itary party thinks to win by camouflage
they are hopelessly mistaken. Mr. Wil
son’s note will find thunderous applause
wherever it will become known.
Providence Journal: The American
people will heartily approve the decla
ration of the President in his message
of yesterday ‘o Germany.
Philadelphia r'ress: The President has
seen a new light.

IN DARING CAPTURE
Mrs. William J. Daigle of this city
has received from her husband, who
is a member of the 103d Infantry, the
old Second Maine, the information
that it was his good fortune to be
one of three soldiers who captured
four Germans recently. Daigle, the
captain’s orderly, and T. H. Cutler,
the gas officer, were down at the
front line with a company of Maine
men. While they were waiting for
the ""getaway” Capt. Cutler saw two
Boches down in a shell hole, waving
their handkerchiefs as if signalling a
wish to surrender. The captain's or
derly slipped off to one side and crept
around the fl.nk of the Germans, go
ing through a trench. ""I got permis
sion to try to start up one of them,”
writes Daigle. “I failed but while I
was at work I saw two more men
coming down the road. It was still
in the dark of Friday morning and
the orderly hid in some brush by the
road until they should come nearer.
They were Bodies all right and I
held them up w'ith my pistol. Bike 99
out of 100 they were only too glad to
surrender. The orderly turned them
taking in a bunch and within 15 min
utes 1 caught the fourth German
in the same fashion. So you can see
what the Second Maine can do.”

GARDINERS REPLY
To Hunt’ Request for Armistice
Over the Top Strong—Manufac
turing Interests Responded Well
The people of Gardiner did not take
kindly to the Huns' plea for an arm
istice and gave a substantial expres
sion of their feelings in the matter
by going over the top to the tune of
1100,000 more than their quota. Gar
dinerites were asked to loan the gov
ernment $254,000 and at the close of
business on Wednesday they had
bought $351,000 worth of the very
best and safest investment imagin
able. After all there is nothing very
surprising in topping the requested
amount by a cool $100,000—it’s rather
getting to be a habit as they have
done the same thing or better in each
of the previous loans.
The committee have served faith
fully and though no house-to-house
canvass has been made, the people
have been requested to bring in their
subscriptions to the banks and have
responded nobly. There are at the
present time 850 subscribers and this
number will increase in all prob
abilities to 900, so it will be seen that
the end is not yet. On the third
drive the number of subscribers was
745.
Manager Barstow felt so sure that
Gardiner was going over the top that
he telephoned for the four barred
honor flag and was promised that
it would be ready and started in five
minutes. The promise was kept as
it arrived bright and early on Wed
nesday morning and now replaces
the three barred one at the post of
fice.
All of the manufacturing enter-4
prises in this city have responded
in grand style and the work at the
Hazzard factory is progressing fine
ly. Already the packing, treeing
and finishing rooms and the pur
chasing department have a hun
dred percent of patriotism, each em
ployee of these rooms having signed
for a bond. When the report comes
in its completeness from the It. P.
Hazzard Co. it will be one to be
proud of.
Please bear in mind that the drive
has not yet closed. Your oportunity
to become a stockholder in the great
est business proposition ever put be
fore the human race will remain open
until Saturday evening. Buy an
other bond.
The general committee on the loan
was as follows: Josiah S. Maxcy,
chairman; George B. Barstow, cam
paign manager; members. Edwin L.
Bussell, Frank E. Boston. Robert I*.
Hazzard, J. Walter Robinson. David
H. Darling. Ernest Wagner, Henry
Richards, Frederick S. Smith, Charles
A. Knight, Harry B. Lawrence,
Charles H. Gray. Fred Strout, M.
Hazen Chase, John W. Berry, Wil
liam E. Maxcy, Charles J. Bragdon,
Edwin W. Ellis.
Farmingdale Goes OveK
Chairman L. V. Clark of the
Farmingdale Liberty Loan committee
■ reports on Wednesday that his town
has gone over the top. With $20,000
j as her quota she has raised $23,350,
and it is hoped that the amount will
■ reach $25,000 before the campaign
I closes. On the first two loans Farm
! ingdale was classed with Gardiner
j and raised her share. On the third
loan she oversubscribed to the extent
of $5000. The committee is com
posed of the following: L. V. Clark,
J. W. Williams, R. E. Manson, Elmer
Stevens. Wilbur I/swell and Wliliam
G. Roberts, the latter two gentlemen
having charge of the rural section.

""Dear Brother: I received your wel
come letter. Was indeed glad to hear
from you. I got your picture. It was
pretty good. We had a few big battles
since 1 wrote to you last. We got after
them about four in the morning to keep
them on the run until dark. I got hit
with shrapnel three times. Got a slight
wound in the left leg. It was getting
stiff all that evening. I thought there
was a bullet stuck in it until I looked
at it the next morning and it was only
a bruise. 1 must have got the flat side.
Another piece hit my belt and broke the
handle of the ire cutters, so my time
isn't up yet. Well, I am glad I downed
a-few of them before they got me. They
played their machine guns on us but we
kept on going anti walked over them
like a horse would trample a tlock of
chickens. Every place the Fighting
Ninth go after it gets them. How are
father and mother getting on? I wrote
to mother a few weeks ago. I wonder
if she got it. I have got a few German
souvenirs I will send as soon as I can.
I had a German helmet but I lost it. 1
may get another later on. No more
this time. From your loving brother,
Stephen J. Cronin.

PRESIDENT’S NOTE
DISPELS DOUBTS GF
ANXIOUS BRITONS
London, Tuesday, Oct. 13—Now
that President Wilson's note of yes
terday is written in history and lias
received virtually unanimous en
dorsement from British newspapers
and public men who have commented
on it, It may be said that there was
considerable uneasiness here while
the public was awaiting the Presi
dent's next move.
The reply of the President, how
ever, instantly dissipated all such
uneasiness, as is attested by the
fervor with which the note has been
received.
The only apparent Itict of unan
imity in the complete approval of
the note is supplied by the compar
atively small group of conciliatory
journals, sometimes classed as pac
ifist, which display some symptoms
of faint heartedness.
Important light is thrown upon
the German point of view by a care
ful reading of the mass of German
newspaper discussion which been re
ceived by the London press. If the
German government intended to give
the impression in its utterances that
it was accepting President Wilson’s
principles, the German newspapers
—and it seems safe to infer from
their comment the German people
also—cherished a different view.
Tli majority of the German newspa
pers seem to think the government
cansentd merely to sit at a confer
ence table and discuss the President’s
principles for the arrangement of
world affairs.

The funeral services of Mia. w-lm A.

Cemetery Friday at 2 p. m., Rev. William
Vaughan of the Trinity Reformed church

Alton K. Braley, Charles H. Twombly,
George H. Robertson and Charles E.

ports a large amount of apples engaged

In a personal note from Bozeman,
Mont., Mrs. Charles A. Pilsbury, who re
cently arrived at the home of her daugh
ter, Mrs. Wm. F. Schoppe, says: “Of
course you wonder why you have not
heard from me, but you will understand
when I tell you I have had the worst cold
or influenza I ever had in my life and I do
not seem to get over it. One day it seems
a little better and the next comes on
again. The influenza is as prevalent here
as in the east. Bozeman is a larger place
t han I expected. It has about 12,000 or
or 13,000 inhabitants, the streets and
sidewalks are all paved and well kept
with trees on each side. They are alf of
soft wood, many of cotton wood, a vari
ety of poplar, weeping white birch, but
no maple or elms. There are many beau
tiful houses, all of modern architecture,
mostly of the bungalow style and very
attractive. It is a busy and bustling city,
with autos and motor trucks flying in
every direction. The most wonderful of
all are the great wheat fields. It seems
as if there is enough to supply the whole
world, if it can be harvested in good con
dition. Most all the men, professional
and business, go out each day at 5 o’clock
p. m. and help in the harvesting work as
long as there is any day light. The
weather has been warm and delightful,
no frost yet to destroy any thing. We
had delicious peas from the garden yes
terday, also tomatoes and cucumbers.
The sweet peas are still in perfection.
Certainly this is a wonderful country.
The mountains are around us on all sides
and are very beautiful. Several morn
ings their peaks have been covered with
s now, but it soon disappears in the warm
sunshine. Often it is hard to tell the
clouds from the mountains. The air is
delightful, so dry and invigorating. There
is a training camp for 400 young men on
the College grounds and they seem very
enthusiastic. Everything is for war.”
Howard E. Wilson, U. of M. ’21, was
operated on for hernia at the Waldo
County Hospital last Thursday by Dr.
Brock of Portland, assisted by Dr. E. A.
Wilson.
The entertainment course to be given
here by the Coit-Alber lyceum bureau

Davis the magician, at a later date.
Mark Dolloff left Saturday for East
Millinockett, where he has a fine position
as an electrical engineer. He will move
his family as soon as he can make
arrangements for them. His Congress
street residence has been rented to Mr.
and Mrs. Hal R. Howard.
Edgar L. Harding, Herbert Morse and
Cleveland Armstrong have returned from
a hunting trip in the vicinity of Kineo,
bringing five deer, the result of seven
days’ hunting. They report big game
much more plentiful than birds. The trip
to and from Greenville was made in Mr.
Harding’s car.
Among the State meetings and con
ventions to be postponed on account of
the prevalance of the influenza are: The
Maine State Sunday School Association,
announced to convene in Bangor on Oct.
22-24; the meeting of the Maine Federa
tion of Women’s Clubs, scheduled for
Oct. 21-22, in Augusta, and the Maine
Teachers’ Convention to have been held
in Portland last week.

the United War Work Campaign, with
membership in the State Committee.
This committee represents all the various
societies who are working for the aid of
the soldier. The Maine Quota is <906,
000 to be raised and it is believed that it
will be easily done. The campaign chair
man for Wgldo county is Orlando E. Frost
of this city. The campaign for funds
will be. one of the hardest from the fact
that so many people seem to have the
impression that .the wsr is about to close,
but they fail to take into consideration
the fact that Washington officials have
■l™>dy stated that the American forces
will have to be maintained overseas tot
several yean in order to look after the
American interests there and see that
the Central Emgirss carry ont the pease
terms that will be demanded of them.

trell of West Somerville, Mass., have

turned.

liss, was also a guest. The evening was
spent socially and refreshments were
served.
According to the reports of'the local
physicians the influenza epidemic condi
tions remain about the same as last
week, with fewer new cases Wednesday.
The closing order for schools, etc., are
still in force and will continue until can
celled by the school committee and the
local board of health. If conditions im
prove so that the schools can open, the
whistles will blow to notify the scholars.
Mrs. Charles Bradbury, chairman of
the Waldo County Liberty Loan Commit
tee, has received special messsages from

THE ROCKLAND NAVIGATION
SCHOOL.
The number .of graduates from the
government’s Free Navigation School in
Rockland was increased to 133 this week
when nine men who have completed the
course went to Bangor and Portland to
take the Federal steamboat inspectors’
examination.
The graduates who went to Bangor
were James Edward Tuttle, Bangor, Ro
land Chamberlain, Hancock, John T.
Irons, Addison, Rodney F: Gray, Castine,
and Arthur E. Newman, South Brooks
ville. The contingent which went to
Portland comprised Kenneth Wooster,
Rockport, Perley W. Lawry, Friendship,
Walter Mitchell, Belfast, and Rufus K.
Fossett, Round Pond.
The new enrollments at the school are
Ernest Spurling, Cranberry Isle, Elmer
Dow, Deer Isle, George Farris, Cutler,
Charles L. Cole, Deer Isle, and William
Young, Rockland.
The school has 41 students, and the
day’s mails seldom fail to include new
applications. Nearly every graduate
now holds an officer's berth in the Mer
chant Marine service.
Industrial Awakening.
According to Secretary of Commerce
Redfield, 30,000 factories in the United
States have been turned over to war
work. A great many things that it
was once deemed impossible to secure
outside of Germany are now in whole
sale production in the United States.
Among these commodities are dyes, and
our factories have made such progress
that Germany will never again be recog
nized in the industry. All our optical
glass was imported from Germany before
the war. Now there are two plants in
the United States, and we are forever
free of dependence from Germany for our
lenses and other fine glass.

It’s Easy—If You Know Dr.
Edwards’ Olive Tablets
The secret of keeping young is to feel
young — to do this you must watch your
liver and bowels — there's no need of
having a sallow complexion — dark rings
under your eyes — pimples — a bilious
lixjk in your face — dull oyc-s with no
sparkle. Your doctor will tell you ninety
per cent of all sickness comes from in
active bowels and liver.
Dr. Edwards, a well-known physician
in Ohio, perfected a vegetable com*
\ pound mixed with olive oil to act on
he liver and bowels, which he gave to
ci:, patients for years.
I Dr. Edwards’ Olive Tablets, the substi
i ■ v f >r calomel, are gentle in their action

hat exuberance of spirit, that natural
I moyancy which should be enjoyed by
; ervone, by toning up the liver and clear

WELL DONE WALDO COUNTY.
Waldo county has shown her patriotism
by a prompt response to the several calls
for aid in carrying on the war. Our
quota of men has gone forward without
delay. There has been no search here for
deserters or for slackers. We have hon
estly conserved food. Our full contribu
tions for Red Cross and M. C. A.
work have been generous. Our women
have been tireless in working for the
comfort of the boys in khaki. In response
to the call for the Liberty Loans the
county has subscribed $1,980,000. In ad
dition to this our people have bought
War Saving and Thrift Stamps to an
amount not known, but large enough to
carry us considerably above the $2,000,
000 mark in our loans. We are justified
in feeling that we have gone gloriously
over the top. In doing all this there has
been no selfishness, and no politics. It
has been pure patriotism, nothing but
love of home and country. All this is
good, but better than this, the record of
Waldo county is the record also of the
State of Maine and of the whole country.
“Over the top for the successful prose
cution of the war ’’ This spirit, this de
votion to the cause of human freedom,
and to our country is what makes our
Nation truly great.

THE LAST GERMAN NOTE.
The text of the reply of Germany to
President Wilson’s last note has been
made public. The document is purely
German from the first word to the last.
When it is not false in statement it is
evasive by intention. This sort of reply
was to be expected from a people who
violated a solemn treaty, invaded Bel
gium and practically destroyed that
peaceful little nation. In the past Ger
many has accomplished much by false
hood and knavery, but today her lack of
honor is known to all men, and all men
deny credence to what she says. Hence
forth we judge her by her performances,
not by her promises'. The entire press of
the country has expressed its rejection of
w'hat the note proposes and the people
will support the statement of the press.
Negotiations with Germany by wireless
are futile and should be discontinued until
the Kaiser and his generals reopen them
with Field Marshal Foch.
CLARENCE M. CURTIS.

Iowa, by two sisters, Mrs. Effie A. Part

T. Bowden of Rumford, and by one half
sister, little Miss Eleanor A. Choate of

and Clarence was shot in the side. They
crawled into a dugout where they re
mained during the night, he suffering in
tense pain. The next morning his com

but whpn they returned he was uncon
scious and died before reaching the hos

was a general favorite with the young
people. He will be greatly missed in the

ed to Mrs. Luella H. Nickerson in her

home there since a small boy.

for the use of those caring for influenza
patients were made last week and placed
in the Searsport Drug Store where they
may be had on application. The local
chapter will furnish as many of these
masks as are needed. Ask your physician
about their use and try to prevent the
spread of the disease through your family.
The following telegram was received at
the University of Maine on Monday by
Dr. LeonS Merrill, State Director: “Gov
ernment daily needs live hundred tons of
shells and pits for use in making gas
masks. Solicit your aid in having cam
paign organized in every community for
collecting and delivering to the Red Cross
for shipment. This is urgent.” To this

tons a day. How many tons can Maine
furnish? Let’s make it big.”

Messrs. Norman and Harold Griffin ar
rived last Sunday frcm Nashua, N. H.,
having entirely gotten over their severe
attacks of influenza. They declared that
home looked good, after their hard ex
periences.
Mr. Earle Trundy who has been ill
with the prevailing distemper was able
to be upon the street last Saturday. Both
he and his employer, Mr. B. B. Sanborn,
were on the list of the sick. Mr. San
born’s store was closed all last week; but
it is expected that it will be open early
this week.
Mr. Bion B. Sanborn and wile have
been suffering from influenza, as well as
their daughter and husband, Mr. and
Mrs. Richard Connor and their son Don
ald. Fortunately, Mr. Sanborn’s mother,
Mrs. Rose Sanborn, and Mr. Connor’s
brother Irving, inmates of the house, es
caped the disease and were able to care
for those afflicted. All are now able to
be up and about.
As these items go to mail, other vic
tims of influenza are reported, in addition
to those already given, namely: members
of the families of Mr. Fred Herriman and
of Mr. Carl Dakin, as well as Mrs. Annie
Verrill and Master Manly Grant. About
forty men are out of the shipyard at
present. Mr. Ed. Littlefield is just re
covering from the influenza and his little
daughter Dorothy is, at present, quite ill
from the same cause.
Our community was deeply shocked
and saddened last Saturday morning by
the news of the death of one of our
ablest young townsmen, Capt. Harry D.
Shute, at his home in Rockland Friday
night. A severe case of influenza de
veloped into pneumonia which weakened
the heart so that a collapse followed,
when he had seemed to be recovering.
His father and mother, Capt. and Mrs.
Elden Shute, were with him during his
illness and added their care to that of his
devoted wife. Mtb. Shute was called
home on Saturday as her daughter, Mias
Louise, was suffering from influenza.
Capt. Shute land the bereaved wife cUttle
on Sunday with the body, and at this
writing 'Monday) it is expected that the
services will be held on Tuesday after
noon. The sympathy of friends goes out
to the mourning family, that this bright
life should go out so early, while it was
still so full of promise. One little son,
Harry D., Jr., is left to comfort the sor
rowing wife.
The State has sent a physician to
Frankfort which relieves Dr. Stevens of
his care in that direction. Many new
cases of influenza in this village are
keeping him very busy with almost no
rest. Among the latest victims in town
are Mrs. Maitland LaFurley, Mrs. Leo
McLean, Mr. and Mrs. John Wardwell,
Stanley Wardwell, and two boarders at
the W’ardwell house, Miss Gladys Dow,
W’alter Trundy, Louise Shute, George
and Ruth Lathrop, Mrs. J. M. Parker
and aunt, Rev. and Mrs. Hully and Mr.
Al. Durham’s entire family. Mr. Geo.
McCullom has lost his wife from influen
za and his children are all ill with the
same disease. Mr. Dunham, on Church
street, is also stricken. Nurses are not
to be had and in many instances where
whole families have been ill at once,
neighbors have kindly lent their aid; and
one of our selectmen, Mr. Alvah Treat,
has done all in his power, to alleviate
su ffering. Scarcity of nurses, due to the
war, makes this epidemic in the civic
population, doubly hard to bear. Let us
all hope for the coming of the sweet days
of peace!

The life less body of Mrs. Susan
oioodi'tch) Fletcher, widow of Pethu
Ul Fletcher, was found about & quar
ter of a mile from her home on the
Middle road close to a clump of woods
during Thursday night by searchers
who had fra red that some disaster
bad befallen the aged woman who
!i\ed alur. \ The conditions surround
ing the body were unusual indeed
and suggested several different opin
ions.
t^o fni as is known Mrs. Fletcher
war lust seen about noon NVednes
rta> in the yard of her home with a
halier in her hand as though start
ing out fo. her horse which she al
lowed to run about the farm largely
»t Us own will during daytimes. She
was discovered lyliiif on the ground,
her fr< t seven feet from a stone wall,
her a pi on soaking In her blood and
her f_<r ieriibly mutilated. A hole
as th'.'. h made by a bullet was no
th table in her neck near the Jaw
bone and liom apparent examination
it would seem that the face might
have been terribly disfigured by the
work of the bullet alone. The the
ory m connection with this is that a
hunter might have fired and hit the
woman unknowingly.
Mioinri inr'Tv, ;mu #1
on'-, ih that tii*' woman was killed by
her *k11»> as the . nimal was known
in i i si,in< what vicious. Tracks of a
hut in :h.i! vicinity indicate that
tli? .nal must have been there rind
tii?' w in intis on the victim's face
might ii.i\c * .1. 11} been mused by the
h*,o . nil shue of a noise. It is prob
ahli that the ■ uppohCri bullet wound
w .is i a lined by lie lung calk on the
KfiO' vvhuh upon examination the
hois* was found lo be wearing.
Then. ton. there is the foul play
theory and .1 strange feature of the
cat* is lh.it the hat worn by Mrs.
Kleti tier was first found and a short
distant• away was i-msiderable
Hood, a* though the unfortunate
wmn.iri bled profusely while lying on
the ground A little ways further on
was found the iloak. some false hair
and more strange than all else the
shoes and stockings of the dead
woman, w hit h she must have re
moved or had removed alter the ac
cident. A little further on was found
t body vvilh a wrapper on, some
what pulled up about the limbs and
the front of the waist unfastened.
The fact that the shoes and stock
ings had been removed and were
found neither w ith the b >dy nor at
the s|>ol where the greater part of
the blood was found gives rise to the
thought of foul play. Nothing was
disturbed at the womans house,
however.
There was some indications that
the body had been removed or rather
dragged to the place where it was
found by the searchers. These tracks
may have been enused by the horse,
however, and one of the things which
indicates that the animal was respon
sible for the death of his mistress is
that Friday tor* noon Deputy Sheriff
l'. H. Chute, who was taking meas
urements of the various locations of
blood, body and clothes, found crush
ed into the gTound by the heavy print
of a horse's hoof the lower set of
the woman's teeth which were bloody.
Numerous heavy horse's hoof prints
suggested that the animal might have
reared about considerably in that lo
mltty. The halter was found near the
spot where the dead woman's clothed
were lying. The body was removed to
the house and an autopsy was per
formed during the day Friday by
Medical Kxanuner Ntinchfield.
The horse was noted by neighbors
nearer the village feeding about with
only his heud halter on Thursday,
i nil .v'lii > nrnjiix saw
no light itt Mm. Fletcher's homo.
After some telephoning It was
deemed wise to make an examination
«*r the premises anil no signs of life
were detected there. The horse, too,
whs missing. The search was begun
and the body tinally located as here- ,
lofore stated.
Mrs. Fletcher, who was about 77 !
years old. was the daughter of the '
late Cyrus Goodrich of Madison and j
« sister of C. W. Goodrich of Hkow- J
hegnn. Another sister. Mrs. George ;
Holbrook, lives in Wilton and a sis- ;
ter, Mrs. Ann Salley of Brewer, Quite !
recently passed away. She was
married to Mr. Fletcher. April 16,
1*91. He died about fifteen years
ago and since that time the widow
had lived much alone, save when
some man of a woman would stay
with her and assist her in the work.
While there nre fairly near neigh
bors, nono are within hailing dis
tance of her home. The indications
are that Mrs. Fletcher was killed
some lime Wednesday, as her poul
try had not. to all appearances, been
fed for a day and a half.
The deceased was a member of the
Bethany Baptist Church here, her i
husband having been a former dea
eon of that society, and was also a
member of Fkoubegan Grange. She
frequently drove to town alone with
the horse Which is more than likely
i ''sponsible for her tragic death. The !
animal is rrfncmbcred by many as '
seeming like an exceedingly treach
erous beast. The horse has now re
turned to the Fletcher farm.
As the result of the autopsy per
formed by Medical Examiner Stinch
held Friday upon the body of Mrs.
Busan Fletcher, who was found dead
In the Held hack of her buildings
with a terribly bruised head, the
decision was that the deceased came
•n her death us the result of being
kicked by a horse, suffering great
l< »s of blood therefrom, and eonse
tuent exposure What was thought
•o have been a bullet wound in the
heed was found to he a puncture
aused by the calk on the shoe of
the horse -Many bones In the face
were broken and there was a slight
bruise on the elbow, sustained
probably in falling This explodes
the foul play theory and Mrs.
Fletcher doubtless removed the parts
""f her clothing found some distance
from her body nfter the accident
when in a deliriuos state. In the
opinion of the Medical Examiner
Mrs. Fletcher must have suffered
greatly before her death.

SIR EDWARD CARSON’S
IDEA OF ARMISTICE
London, Thursday, Oct. 24. via
Montreal—Speaking a^ Oxford to
day,-Sir Edward Carson drew atten
tion to Germany's minimum de
mands when she thought she was
victor. These included the surrender
of Malta. Gibraltar and the Suez
canal. He heartily concurred in
President Wilson’s note, saying:
""Today our armistice terms must ;
be the equivalent of Germany's In
1870. It was then agreed and pro
vision made that all German guna
should be placed advantageously
around Parle eo that the city could
be taken at pleasure. Anythin*

U. S. BIG GUNS
(Continued from Page One)
in point of destructive force they are
incomparable. |
The organization to man each gun j
lequires one entire train, including
the gun car itself, ammunition cars,
a crane car, and construction, sand,
timber, kitchen, fuel workshop, staff
radio cars. Many of the cars were
especially manufactured by the
Standard steel Car Co. and the Lo
comotives. 83-ton types with four
pairs of drivers were built by the
Baldwin Locomotive works. One car
is a complete machine shop, equipped
with forge, lathes, grinders and drill
presses. The gun car and the am
munition cars ""are heavily armored,
1601 square feet of platform being re
quired.
The gun car is convertible into a
form of pit foundation to permit fire
at a high angle of elevation and it
was said that the entire process of
placing the gun in that position and
restoring it to complete mobility re
quires only a few minute/. Under test
on its steel carmounting the gun has
shown accuracy of fire at longer
ranges than ever before possible with
guns of such great calibres. Direction
of the fire upon any target is made
possible simply by shifting the post
tion of the gun's mount on the tracks.

the naval pun factory in Washington

Jan. 25. The first gun wa3 completed
ill April and tests were held at the
army proving grounds at Sandy
Hook, X. J., in the presence of army
and navy officials and representatives
of the allied governments.
The training of the men to operate the
big guns was of a most intensive na
ture. The gun crews, who are compos
ed of officers from the regular navai
forces and the naval reserves, and jf I
men taken for the most -part from the !
Great Lakes '.raining station, were r.n- j
ployed as inspectors at the plants mtn-i
ufacturing the guns. This training, j
combined with experience gained in j
handling heavy projectiles and powder j
charges at the naval proving ground, j
Secretary Daniels said, made possible j
the obtaining of a thoroughly efficient!
force.
Details of the construction of the guns I
end the part they have played In the'
victories on the western front have been |
withheld for military reasons.

U. S. FOOTING IN
BELLEAU WOODS
MORE SECURE
With the American Army Northwest
of Verdun. Oct. 25.—(By the Associated
Press).—There has been comparatively
little alteration in the positions on the
center but the American footing in Bel
leau Woods east of the Meuse was more
securely fixed, notwithstanding the de
termined efforts of the Germans to force
the Americans back.
The fighting for positions just beyond
Belleau Woods began at 4 o'clock infs
morning when the Americans drove
their way forward. At daylight the
Germans counter attacked and since the
failure of that operation have launched
another attack against the Allies unsuc
cessfully. Clouds and ground mists re
duced aerial activity to a minimum out
artillery employing both high explosive
and gas projectiles in enormous quanti
ties was used by both sides. Besides
the artillery reaction at points where
the offensive was in progress the Ger
mans devoted much fire to the hack
areas and that portion of the Iront
about Bantheville where the American
line was advanced slightly.
Despite the desperate resistance of the
Germans and the lack of attention do
counter offensive, information falling in
to the hands of the Americans continues
to indicate an enemy withdrawal to the
Priqenay line, one informant declaring
it to be the intention of the Germans to
withdraw to that position between Oct.
25 and 31.

COLBY AND NAVAL
RESERVES PLAY
0 TO 0 TIE GAME
Watervillc. Me., Oct. 27.—In a slow
same playyed on a muddy, slippery
field, the Rockland Naval Reserves
and the Colby S. A. T. C. playyed a
0 to 0 tie game on Alumni field here
Saturday. Colby had the advantage
throughout the game as she keut the
ball in Rockland's territory the great
er part of the time, but could not
menage to score. Colby's goal was
only threatened once, that being in
the first of the last period when Dev
lin had a good opening for a drop
kic k but failed miserably. The con
dition -it the field had, much to do
v.-.ti, this as Devlin is a brilliant
player, shining for Holy Cross.
The nearest e""ther side came to
scoring was near the end of the first
half when Colby was within a foot
f f the goal post and undoubtedly
would have scored had not the whis
tle blown. One of the features of the
game was the long forward pass,
from McCracken to Wolman, netting
over .10 yards. Cook, Colby’s star
gu. ru. played a fine game until he
was injured and had to be replaced.
The v. hole Colby backfield did good
work ripping through the Rockland
bne again and again only being pre
venter! rrom larger gains pecause or
the slippery field. Devlin and Mor
rissey were the star players for
Rockland. The Navy boys were ac
companied by a good number of sup
porters.
At the close of the game Libby Pul
sifer, a last year's letter man. who
plajed a star game at end, all sea
son. was elected captain of the Col
by team. *

Waterville Police Circle
The Wat'-v.lle police department was
a busy place Saturday and Sunday and
a member of the department staled
Sunday night that it ws like the old
circus days in Waterville when the cells
were filled, and then the officers brougni
more drunks in, they were placed in
cells with other drunks. During Satur
day night and Sunday 15 were placed
m the cell for intoxication, there were
two fights and two automobile accidents,
all due to liquor which had evidently
been brought to the city from other
cities or sent here from out of the Stats.
Early Sunday afternoon they began to
arrive in the city from Skowhe-piri,
Fairfield, Augusta and, in fact, ifro.-.i
various other places, and late in the
evening there had been 15 placed in .he
cells to await hearing. Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock court will probably
open, and one of the most sensational
hearings will be held at this time.
For a long time Waterville has been
rid of Its drunks, but things seem to
have broken loose up river, and t;<is
seems to be r landing place for ooth
men and women who have indulged it)
what looks to be stronger than water
and as a result the watchman at the :ity
buildir.g. together with the help of r.o
Iicetnen and the deputy, had a busy
night Sunday in trying to please their
night guests.
Mrs. Carroll Butterfield
Mrs. Bthel H. Butterfield passed away
Saturday afternoon at the Sisters hos
pital after an iiiness with pneumonia.
She was ill only a short time and the
whole community was saddened to loa'n
of her sudden death. Her age was
years. Two years ago she was married
to Carroll Butterfield, a druggist em
ployed at the Dunbar drug store. Be
sides her husband she is survived by an
infant eon, Carroll Jr.; her mother, Mrs.
Charles Hendersos of Milo, and a sister,
Mre. Edith Tibbetts of Milo. The 'u
neral services will he held from the
home at 9 o'clock Monday morning and
the remains will be taken to Milo, where
services will be held and burial will tak;
place.
Coburn to Open Nov. 4
Although the schools in the city
have been ordered to open Monday
morning, after a three-weeks recess.
Principal Harthornc of Coburn Clasg*
leal Institute stated Saturday that the
Institute will remain closed until a
week from Monday. He said that it
would he impossible to notify all stu
dents of the opening, and that it
would not be possible to open the in
stitute for study until Wednesday of
this week, so Saturday afternoon ho
notified the students of the opening
which will be Monday, Nov. 4.' He

would be better checked about the
city.

PEOPLE ASKED TO
REFRAIN FROM
PUBLIC PLACES
In spite of the fact that the ban has
been lifted and that all places of amuse
ment, schools, churches and the other
places that were affected by the Cioc
ing order are open, the people in the
city are asked to still refrain from at
tending all public gatherings- The epi
demic in the city has not reached 'tJ
limit, as there are still several cases
here and a few new ones break out ev
ery day, but the members of the boarl
of health thought conditions so muci
improved that it was voted at the last
meeting of the board to lift the ba-i
from the closing order and again na-’»
the usual entertainments around ihs
city. The people in the City are askel
to heed the signs which have been plac
ed In various stores byt the board of
health ^nd take as much precaution as
possible to prevent th epidemic spread
ing any more. The mayor of the city
has especially asked people to keep
away from crowds as much as possible
as there are still a lot of people sick ard
. people must be careful. Saturday nigoi
| there were 10 new cases reported to the
i l oard and there were three deaths dur
I ing thrf day of the epidemic, whlcn^ re
| suited in pneumonia. Only one dccto
| had reported to the board Sunday night
but the secretary of the board, ,»Lr,
Bunker, said he felt that the epidcml
was surely clearing up and that in th
two days there were not over 15 u tv
cases if there were that many. Most ef
the cases are mild which have been re
cently reported, and as far as can bi
learned there are not very many rea
severe cases reported here at present
although in t»a past two weeks ther
have been cases which have proven is
tai. The sign which is attracting'much
attention along the street anti which
people are asked to read and abide, will
certainly be a help to the epidemic if
city people will, as much as possible,
refrain front public gatherings. The pos
ter is very attractive and tontains read
ing matter about the prevention of the
disease, besides a picture of the gaum
mask which i being worn by doctors
and nurses to prevent the disease.

UPWARD REVISION
OF WAGES IN ALL
SHIPYARDS COUNTRY
Washington, Oct. 27.—Upward revision
ir all shipyards of the country to pro
vide uniform national rates for practi
cally all the shipyard trades, effective
immediately, was announced today by
the shipbuilding labor adjustment
board. Two treat districts are created,)
one for tne Pacific coast and the other
embracing the Atlantic and Gulf coasts
and Great Lakes. In the first, increases
average 20 per cent. In the second 13
per cent., with the basic rates for the
principal skilled trades fixed at SO cen's
per hour in both. This decision will le
reviewed every six months and further
increases granted if costs of living war
rant. Owing to diversity of conditions
ir various parts oUthe country It was
r.ot found advisable to establish a na
tional uniform scale for laborers, rates
for them having been fixed on three
bases: The Pacific const, the North A*-!
lantic and Lakes, and the South Atlfln-1
tic and Gulf.
No changes in existing piece work;
rates are to be made until after ioii-j
ferences between representatives of the i
shipyards and the piece work crafts to;
lie held here this week. i
Further extension of the premium, bo- >
mis and contrac' systems in effect in*
some yards is prohibited unless used by |
the board. The decisions directly af-!
feet about ino.000 shipyard workers and J
the board believes they will have r.n ’
indirect bearing on the wages of other j
workers in all parts of the country.

Hand-work to Help Heads
(Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph) j
Since the publication of the fact j
tha. Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of the |
Free Synagogue New York, and his j
18-year-old son were working in a •
Connecticut shipyard at $3 a day re- j
por' •• have been received of hundreds j
of ministers and other professional j
men who are rendering similar pa- i
iriotic service. In one Maine yard j
four clergymen are working as ship- !
builders. Professor W. W. Andrews, ■
principal of the Butler Grammar I
School of Portland, who has gone to j
work for the Cumberland Shipbuild- I
ing Company, says: ""I had twelve- j
weeks vacation and I didn't care to J
loaf. The country needed -ships of all !
things, and I considered it a privilege !
to enter the yards and do my share. !
I am 59 years old, but assuredly I !
can contribute my portion to the ;
necessary work of the country.” Pro- j'
lessor Andrews’ son, one of the first j
to enlist in the war, was killed in the j
drive at Cambrai last fall.
These men from the learned pro- j
fessions who are working with their i
hands are helping their country, but !
they are also helping themselves. 1
The preacher, the lawyer, the educa- !
tor, the editor who dons overalls and J
acquires a pair of calloused palms !

Twain in one of his books showed !
the fallacy in the saying that brain j
work is more exhausting than man- •
ual labor. The latter lacks the ele- |
ment of interest. Intellectual labor i
is largely its own reward. The artist 1
literary or otherwise, takes the keen- j
cst delight in hie task of creation. '
He would Infinitely rather work at i
his profession than dr nothing. But :
there are no such incentive® tn ordi

this summer are gaining a new in- j
sight into the life of the toiler and
the result will be broadened sympa- J

From Senator Dodge: ""But there is
one question o i which X wish to say a
few words an 1 that seems to me to
override all others. It is whether we
shall stand by the administration an!
the President at this juncture. If we
give a victory to his political opponents

Spanish commissioners in Paris that the
people of the United States repudiate its
result and repudiate the man who has
led victoriously the war and is now
leading us back to peace—William Mc
Kinley.” '
From Senator Penrose: “In his re
cent speeches the President has ap
pealed not to a partisan but to a
national spirit. He wants Pennsylva
nia to remain the keystone state for
the Republican party. It is difficult to
over-estimate the importance of sus
taining the President of the United
States and the Republican party at
the present critical crises in our for

er: ""The war came while a Republi

""I do not believe any fair-minded
l-tmocrat would question the fitness
of the Republican party for the dis
charge of this duty but, however, ’t
might be otherwise. The work is in
the hands of President McKinley. He
wants the support of the House of

battleships, advocating the substitute n
of smaller and more active craft for :m
\al warfare. As one of the. closing fea
tures of his career he fought the pas
sage of President Taft's reciprocity
agreement with Canada with a bitter an
tagonism wnlch made him unpopular
among a large number of liis constit
uents in Maine, a State which is sntd
to have favored the reciprocity plait,
and athis is said to have influenced h's
retirement from the fight for re-elec- !
tion.
Senator Hale was born in Turner. Me.
June ft. 183B, of an old and wealthy fam
ily, and after his education at Turner
and Hebron academies he began the
study of law and became a practitioner
in Ellsworth In 1857. He was prosecut
ing attorney for Hancock county for
nine years, and in 1X67 began his legis
lative career as a member of the Stale
House of Representatives. He was
chairman of the committee of the Legis
lature to investigate what has since be-in
known as the “State steal."" it oemg
charged that the Democrats and Green
backers attempted illegally to obnin
possession of the State government. In
those times, which were exciting outs <n
Maine, Mr. Hale became an acknowl
edged leader.
“He married the daughter of Zaeh
ariah Chandler. Senator from Michi
gan, in 1871. by whom he had a son,
Frederick Hale, who was also promi
nent in Maine politics, and who en
tered the United States Senatorial
contest in Maine as a candidate in
1916.
When he first sought election to the
United States Senate in 1 SSI. there
was n l itter contest between him and
\Yiiliaot I*. Frye. Mr. Hale was suc
cessful, but Mr. Frye, in the same
year, icceived an appointment to the
Senate to fill the vacancy caused by
the appointment of Janes G. Blaine
to the position of Secretary of State,;
so that it. happened that both Mr.
Frye and Mr. Hale entered the Sen- i
ate together, the latter, however, the j
senior Senator.
in 18GS, and 1878 and 1880. Mr. Hale;
was delegate to the Republican Na- I
tional Conventions and on the last !
t.wo occasions labored zealously for j
t'.;e nomination of Blaine, and for his !
election in the campaign against
Cleveland in 1883.
He was appointed postmaster gen- <
era! by President Grant in 1871, and j
was tended the r>-»val portfolio by i
f’teaident Hayes, but he declined I
both of these cabinet positions, pre- !
ferr'ng to remain in Congress.
He did later accept the appointment !
as member of tile National Monetary
Commission, and m Congress bis abil
ity was recognized time after time
bv appointment to the most import
ant committees, and his retention on
them year after year. While he was
in the lower House he was cha:rman
of the Republican congressional com
mittee and in the Senate be was
chairman of the committee on appro- j
priations, chairman of the commit- i
tee on public expenditures, and on:- j
of the weightiest members of the !
committees on finance, and naval af- ■
fairs and census, lie possessed an un
surpassed intimate knowledge of im- J
portant departments of the nation's!
housekeeping, and lie was credited !
with saving the country millions by j
bis persistent stand for economies.
His tactics were not those of an jra-'
tor. When he first came to Congress he'
dazzled no one. But he was ""alwd/3
on the job"" or “in continuous session,' .
and while his colleague Frye was strong:
in forensic debate and “Tom ’ Heed tui- *
ployed his wit in a spectacular manner, :
Mr. Hale wen*, along In a quiet, unoo-i
trusive way and by his sheer staying,
qualities he became a power like Ken-!
ator Edmunds. He hack a positive gifti
for finding out the weak points of any!
project and turning the battery of sar- j
castic invective upon it.
In personality he was an aristo.-rat.'
He married the daughter of Zacharmhl
Chandler, senator from Michigan, In I'd!, !
by whom he had a son. His brotaer !
Clarence Hale, is a United States d.s*
trlct judge at Portland, Me.
Upon his retirement Senator Hale re

Remarkable Record American
Army, in First Big Operation
In Less Than Month’s Tim*
With the American Army North
west of Verdun, Oct. 26—(By the
Associated Press)—In its first major
operation against the Germans, con
sidering the clearing out of the St.
Mihiel salient as a local affair* the
American army in a few days less
than o month has liberated more
average depth of ten miles, freeing
165 square miles of territory. In the
offensive the Americans harve cap
tured more than 20,000 prisoners.
The Americans attacked on a front
of 20 miles from the Argonne to the
Aleuse and the advance has been
made in the face of almost insur
mountable difficulties due principally
to the nature of the ground which is
covered with hills, deep ravines and
woods. Ir» addition the Americans
had fronting them four organized
systems of trenches—the Hir.denburg
line, the Hagan position, the Volker
position, and the Kriembilde posi
tions.
They have forced their way
through all these lines. Ahead of 1
them lies Freya. a position which has
been reached at one point in the re
gion of the Bantheville wood.
The advance has been particular
ly difficult because the Germans have j
resisted every foot of the way and ,
have used me Ac than 33 divisions on ,
the 20-mile front. The enemy contin
ues to make a formidable effort to
hold this front In order to protect
his great lateral lines of communi
cation running through Hirson, Me
zieres, Sedan, Montmedy and T-on
guynn. This line already is threat
ened and should the Germans lose it
than
advanced to an
they will lose their main line of con,
munication from Germany into «
cupied France.
In addition to the prisoner* q^,
Pershing’s men have taken n^.,,
than 1ST guns of large calibre, numer.
our machine guns and anti-tak guo,
a great store of ammunition and
much war material, including lucomo.
tives and railway cars.
Since Sept. 26 the Americans have
fired more than 2,500,000 shells, the
number at times reaching as high as
150,000—the guns used include a great
number of heavy ones and also some
captured from the enemy.
American aviators and nnti-airvtaf*
guns in the period since Sept. 27 na e
brought down 239 enemy machines ani
23 enemy balloons despite adverse light,
ing condition and bad weather at
times. The bombing airplanes droopy)
more than 40.000 kilograms of explosive
,on railroad centers, troops coneentrt.
tions and other points behind the en*:riy
lines.
From the view of the engineer tin
most difficult task faced has been
repairing of roads and the movement n(
supplies, men, ammunition and food to
the front. More than 49.W0 engine
troops are employed day and night ia
rebuilding she'l-shattcred roads, uSin?
where possible crushed rock from Mi
lages destroyed by the German shalii.
In the Argonne hundreds of yards (<
German barbed wire entanglements t.«.
tened from tree to tree at various
heights had to be bridged hr it was mv
possible to cut them. In add.tion nusv
roads in the Argonne were of olack
loam which beccine a morass in rainy
weather. The engineers were Compeilcj
to virtually build bridges over m.ir
miles of these road3.
General Ludeodorff, Germany’s
Great Military Head, Resigns
Emperor Accepts Resignation
Copenhagen, Oct. 27—Gen. louden- 1
dorff. first quartermaster general of
the German army, has resigned says
a telegram from Berlin. In accept
ing his resignation the Emperor has
decreed that the lower Rhenish in
fantry regiment No. 39 of which Gen.
Endendorff has long been command
er, shall bear his name.
In the resignation of Gen. Luden
dorff Germany loses what has often
been described as her ""Military
brain.”
Unknown before the war. Gen. Lu
Oendorff sprang into prominence in
the fall of 1914 as chief of staff to
field marshal Von Hindenburg, then
a general, in the operations against
thj Russians. When Von Hinden
burg was given the chief command
in August, 1916, Uudendorff was ap
pointed first quartermaster general,
but his position in reality has been
< hief of staff and collaborator with
Von Hindenburg.
Soon after his appointment as first
quartermaster-general, Ludendorff
began to be looked upon as the real
""Ross” of Germany and was recog
nize 1 as the representative of the
pan-Germans at Great headquarters.
It was Ludendorff who brought
about the retirement of Chancellor
Von Bethmann Hollweg and he was
repl ied to have been responsible for
the appointment to the chancellor
ship of Michaeiis and Von Hertling.
both of whom were described as stop
gaps. The general’s rule as first
quartermaster general has almost
amounted to military dictatorship.
Gen. Ludendorff was reported to
have been the organizer of the Ger
man offensive of 1918. The plan call
ed for offensive operations on the
western front which would split the
British and French armies and com
pel the allies to beg for peace before
the strength of the American army
could be felt to any great extent. It
was planned that if the offensive fail
ed then Germany would resort to a
diplomatic campaign in order to ob
tain peace.
Since the defeat of the German of
fensive and the successful offensive
of Marshal Foch reports from Ger
many have been to the effect that
Ludendoi-fr an^J Von Hindenburg were
losing their popularity in Germany,
both because peace did not result
front the German attacks and be
cause of the heavy casualties suffer
ed by the Germans.
Early in October reports from Ber
lin were that Ludendorff had suffer
ed a physical collapse and that hr
had prepared to resign. On Oct. U,
Ludendorff was said to have become
so enraged over the German pence
note that he offered his resignation.
There also have been reports recent
ly that he was not on good terms
with other German military loaders,
especially Crown Prince Rupprech!
of Bavaria. A neutral country on Oct.
19 said that Gen. l.udendorff was re
ported to have told the imperial
crown council that Germany might
bein vaded in a few weeks.
At first Quartetmustor-Gcrteral I.u
dendorijf was responsible for the of
ficial statements issued from German
general headquarters. He is the man
who has explained to the German
people how the Gorman troops dur
ing the past three months have car
ried out ""strategic withdrawn!*.-’
LONDON THINKS
RESIGNATION MEANS
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
London. Oct 27.—The resignation ff
Gen. LudendorIT is popularly intcrprete.l
here as heralding Germany's arcephi ift

al cannot fall to seriously uffect ilie mo
rale of the German army. Rumors nave
been current for some time r<ast if »
disagreement between Field Marshal
von Hindenburg and Ludendorff, rid
that von Hindenburg lias approved of
the pea tie n?gotiatior.s.
Unofficial advices say that the great
est sensation was caused in Merlin .V*
I'rday when it was observed that l.uiUei
dorft's name at the bottom of the <»m
munique had beer, replaced by that nf
the chief of staff of the armies in lb<

The water in the river was still ris
ing on account of the rain of the week
and there was a good head of water
Friday i n the Augusta dam, but noth
ing of the nature of a freshet. In the
lower river the water was within
about three feet of the top of some of
the wharves.. It was thought prob
able yesterday that the water had
reached its maximum height and
would today begin to recede.
Traffic between Augusta and Hallo
well on the L., A. & W. Street Kail- j
way was delayed for a short time
about 9 o'clock Friday evening by a j
piece of the trolley wire about 75 feet j
long, falling from the posts at the |
lower part of Hines hill. The car j
leaving Water street at 9 o'clock for j
Hallowell had just commenced to '
climb the hill when the wire snap- !
ped, and the passengers were trans- j
ferred to another car at tho top of ■
the hill.
Information Regarding Death!
Of Corporal Emmons Boynton j
In Latter Received by His Mother, j
Mrs. W. A. Boynton of This City, ;
from Bureau of Communication,
American Red Cross, Washington,
D. C.
Definite information regarding the j
death of Corporal Emmons A. Boyn
ton of the Headquarters Co., 103rd
Inf., who was killed June 16th in
France, is contained in letters recent
ly received by his mother, Mrs. W. A.
Boynton of 94 State street, from W.
R. Castle, Jr., of the Bureau of Com
munication, American Bed Cross,
Washington. D. C.
The letter from Mr. Castle reads
as roiiows:
“We have received from Paris some ;
of the definite details of the death of '
Corporal Emmons A. Boynton, which
we know you anxiously await.
“The news we received states that
on the morning of June ICth at 9.20
while eating his breakfast Corporal
Boynton was hit in the head by fly
ing shrapnel which caused his death.
He did not die instantly, however,
but was removed at once to a hos
pital at - and passed away at
3.15 that same day. We are Quite sure
that he was buried in the cemetery
adjoining the hospital. His sergeant
visited his grave the next day with
some companions and found the
grave completely covered with flow
ers. His personal effe-ts were sent to
the Effects Bureau, which you can
obtain by writing to Capt. John R.
Nelson, quartermatser of effects, Ho
boken, N. J., giving him your son’s
full military address. The report also
contained the fact that Emmons
Boynton w»as acclaimed the most pop
ular man in the company, which we
feel is a beautiful tribute to be paid
to one.
“The Bed Cross extends deep sym
pathy in this hour of your great loss
and sorrow. America today has many
loyal women whose loved ones have
found their last resting place in
French soil. They must try to bear
their loss bravely, knowing that the
name of their son is on the roll call
of our heroes that the nation will
ever hold in sacred memory.”
The letter from Major C. C. Pierce,
chief of the Graves Registration Ser
vice. A. E. F., gives information re
garding the location of the grave of
Corporal Boynton.

Old Time Engines
tJ°h~ **•, WiKht- baggage master at
the Gardiner station of the Maine
C,el*ral R- R- has two photographs
or the old-time engines of the road
which he prizes very highly. The first
Is of one of the first locomotives used
in the State, one of the old Bangor
and Veazie road, of the wood burning
type. It was very small and had four
wheels, the tender ueing a separate
vehicle and having the same number
of wheels. The smokestack is shaped
much like an inverted bell. All the
machinery was uncovered and there
w-as no cab for the engineer and fire
man. The photograph bears the
name of a Bangor photographer.
The second is a picture of an en
gine of the old European and North
American Railroad, which operated
between Bangor and anceboro, what
is now the eastern division of the
Maine Central. This engine is a vast
improvement over the one shown in
the first described picture. Both en
gine and tender have eight wheels
each and there is a comparatively
bcdcrn cab for those operating the
locomotive. This engine was also a
wood burner and the same style of
stack is a prom'nent feature. The
headlight is of huge dimensions and
would make several of those of the
present day, with probably consid
erable less illuminating power. One
peculiar feature of this old-timer is
the running board that extends the
entire length of the engine and which
was used for oiling up while the en
gine was underway. Mr. Wight priz
es these photographs highly as
there are but few extant.

The game was somewhat loosely

forward pass which led to one of the
touchdowns, while the other came
from a forward pass from Glidden

Miss Violet E. Robinson
The Gardiner General Hospital has
sustained a severe loss in the leath
of the superintendent. Miss Violet E.
Robinson. Coming to the hospital
at the time of its opening last spring,
Miss Robinson brought a wealth of
young and enthusiastic life, backed
by a fine training for her chosen pro
fession as nurse. Miss Robinson's
charming personality and splendid
ability soon won for the hospital a
place among the best of such insti
tutions in the State of Maine. Hen
unselfish devotion to her work led
her into such a sacrifice of self that
when stricken with influenza a few
days ago, her tired body could not
rally under the cruel strain. Death
came at the close of the day on
Saturday.
A beautiful spirit, a valued friend
and a tireless worker has gone from
our midst. To her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Wesley Robinson of Houlton.
Me., we extend our deepest sympa
thy. While sharing their sorrow we
also cherish the legacy of a life
marked by a noble selflessness sel
dom surpassed. For her there sure
ly was heard the joyous welcome,
“Well done, • * * enter thou into the
joy of thy Lord.”
Greenleaf Lawrence
Greenlcaf Lawrence, an old and re

Mr. Lawrence was a member of the

leaves two daughters, Mrs. J. W.

three sons, Harry’ B., Guy W. and

It was quite a come-down for Mrs.
Breslin to actually beg the daughter
of a common hod-carricr to marry
her aristocratic son. But when a girl
steps in at the last moment and sac
rifices her good name to save the life
of the man she loves, who is falsely
accused of a murder, you can hardly
be blamed for being grateful to that
young person. And Ellen Shannon
proved what a real woman she was
when she told about that poker game
across the hall front that hotel bed

full of punch and pep. Margery Wil

TERMS TO AUSTRIA
(Continued from Page One)
by the allied and American govern
ments conferring peace settlements
with Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria
until Germany also shall surrender
or be crushed. This policy is count
ed upon to prevent any eleventh
hour attempt on the part of the
Germans to sow seeds of discord
| among the allies. I,, view of the
j General situation the smashing
, Franco-American victories north
and west of Verdun are regarded
as significant. Unless an armistice
interrupts, it is believed the thrust
will be pushed home relentlessly to
cut the German front in the west in
half before there is another halt.
With hardened mountaineers of
the Italian army available for use
with the surrender of Austria, some
observers look for immediate pre
| paring for the invasion of Ger
many by way of Alsace-Lorraine.
Italian picked troops might be
spared at once to join such a cam
paign as they would not be needed
to carry out operations incidental
to the Austrian surrender. Not only
wil lthe whole fighting man power
of allied and American armies be
available now for the task of
crushing Germany's defensive front
but to supplement the already
vastly superior equipment of those
armies in guns, aircraft, and all
other war machinery there is now
at the disposal of Marshal Foch all
the Bulgarian, Turkish and Aus
trian military equipment. To ans
wer such concentration Germany
has on’y depleted reserves of men,
guns and munitions.

With 200 girls under the supervis
ion of the State School in this city
and with 30 names on the Institu

the incorrigible ones is becoming
more and more a problem to the

under construction will accomodate
only about 23 girls, besides making
available some additional school
room. There lias been an effort to
extend the cottage system. The
needs are so pressing that it is be
lieved further steps must be taken
shortly to meet the situation.
Mrs. Orella McG. Beane
At 7.30 Saturday evening Mrs.
Orella McG. Beane, after a long ill
ness, passed to the higher life. Mrs.
Beane was born in Stockton Springs,
Maine, Dec. 11, 1S49. She attended
Westbrook Seminary where she
graduated in 1S72. In 1876 she mar
! ried Fred Emery Beane of Read
field and after two years residence
| there they moved to llallowell,
j where they have lived forty years,
i Mrs. Beano was a great lover of
nature and nature’s bounties and
took great enjoyment in her summer
home at Lake Cobbosseecontee.
She always took a very active part
in the church and social life of Hal
j lowell. where she will be greatly
■ missed. She was a woman of ster
j ling character and was able to get
, out of lift its larger and higher
meaning. Mrs. Beane leaves a hus
j band, Judge Fred Emery Beane of
| the Kennebec Superior Court, two
! sons. Dr. Charles H. Beane of Hal
1 lowell and Capt. Emery O. Beane,

services will be held Tuesday after
noon at 2 o’clock from the Beane
residence, conducted by her pastor,
Rev. E. W. Webber.
makes a direct appeal for votes. This
most unusual attempt of the head of
the government to use his power for
party advantage in time of war to
try to capitalize the people's patriot
ism for partisan purposes has aroused
the nation as nothing since the Civil
War. McAdoo, head of the treasury
and of the fcdeial hoard in charge
of the banking resources of the na
tion, and head of the capital issues
committee in control of all new en
terprises, both public and private,
director-general of all transportation,
railway and international and water
ways with more than 11,000,000 em
ployes; McAdoo, of Georgia, whose
prejudices are made known by his
appeal printed on railway schedules
in which he names the wars our na
tion has engaged in but omits men
tion of our greatest past war, the
Civil War, an insult to every Ameri
can citizen, McAdoo pleads for a
Democratic Congress for the sake of
unity.
“Mr. Burleson of Texas, head of
the postal system; director of tele
graphs and telephones, with thou
sands of employes on behalf of the
present control, permits to be issued
from this office a call to arms. While
rumor persists that a stamp will be
used for party purposes the people
cannot be deceived as they were in
1916.”
Attorney General Gregory said:
""The partisan issues were injected
into tiie approaching election by men
who are admittedly the leaders of
the Republican party. The President
is regarded by the world as its most
influential citizen and by our allies
as their chief spokesman. Neverthe
less Col. Roosevelt, the accepted un
official leader of the Republican par
ty in the Cnited States, has by ev
ery means in his power sought to
i destroy the confidence reposed by the
people in the President and to weak
en teh authority with which the lat
ter is clothed. In a more subtile way
the leader of the Republican party
has pursued the same course. Here
j tofore these gentlemen could hard
! lv be said to have occupied a more
1 Signified i osition than the tradi
! tional dog that bayed at the moon.
| A very different condition would
arise if the party led by them ob
tained control of either house of
Congress, ’where it could prevent the
passage of legiriation essential to
the further carrying out of the Pres
ident’s policies.”
Forty United States Senators, out
of a roster of 96 in the upper house,
and 435 Representatives, the entire
membership of the lower branch of
Congress, will be elected. Possible ef
fect of the election on the political
complexion of the Senate may be seen
in the Democrats’ present slim ma
jority. They have 52 votes to the Re- ;
publicans' 44, with 49 necessary for
control. In the House there are 215 j
Democrats and 209 Republicans, to- j
gether with a few scattered votes in !
the minor parties. The strength nec- I
essary to a majority is 218.
Full state tickets, including Cover- :
nor, will lie elected in the following
2S states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkan- ;
sas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, i
Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas Massa- |
chusetts Michigan, Minnesota, Ne- i
braska, Nevada, New Mexico, New j
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklaho
ma, Oregon. Rhode Island. South
Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Ver
mont, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
In Pennsylvania and Tennessee the ■
governor's chair and one or two mi- |
nor offices will be filled and in New i
Hampshire the vote will be for Gov- j
ernor only.
Ten states will choose minor offi- ,
cials today, as follows: Delaware, [
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louis
iana, Missouri, Montana, North Caro
line, Utah and Washington.
Florida, Maryland, Mississippi,
New Jersey. Virginia and West Vir
ginia will elect no state officers, but j
will choose member* of Congress.
Six states will vote on prohibition j
amendments. California will offer a
choice of two measures, one for a
“bone dry” commonwealth, the other
wiping out saloons and prohibiting
manufacture or sale of liquors, except
light wines, Colorado voters will pass
on a proposal to supplant their pres
ent partial prohibition law with a
“bone dry” statute, and in Ohio an
amendment prohibiting manufacture
or sale of intoxicants for beverage
purposes will come up. Washington’s
proposed amendment would prohibit
possession, even, of intoxicants ex
cept for sacramental purposes, and
\\ j oining's would stop manufacture
or sale, though specifically excluding
science and industry from the effects
of prohibition. Utah will vote on
changes in the phraseology, of its
“dry” statute.
Prompted by war conditions, Cali
fornia and Maryland, whose laws
make no provision for exercise of the
franchise by voters outside the state,
will submit amendments enabling
soldiers and sailors to vote, wherever
they may be.
South Dakota will vote on equal
suffrage for women.

STATE TICKET
Poston, Nov. 3—Gov. Samuel W.
McCall, who has not taken an active
pait in the Republican campaign
for the election next Tuesday, en
dorsed the state ticket in a letter
received today by Gorge A. Bacon,
chairman of the Republican state
committee. Referring to the candi
dacy of Senator John W. Weeks for
reelection and to the Republican
congressional nominees, the Gov
ernor said: “With regard to the na
tional candidates, my duty to give
honest council to my fellow-citizens,
when giving council at all, impels
me to say that the vote I am to
give for those candidates of my
party would not he given if I be
lieved that the issues which have
been quite recently thrown into the
campaign possessed validity. I re
fer to the attitude of denunciation
taken toward the president regard
ing his recent diplomatic corre
spondence and to the implied if not
positive assertion of the rights of
the Senate to take part In the pre
liminary negotiations of treaties.
“The Republican party has never
stood for such a doctrine and it
ne\er will until it shall be prepared
to issue a decree of banishment
against millions of its most liberal
members. I believe that the party
may be trusted to move forward In
the . clear lights of its history and
that its representatives as a whole
nnd its rank and file will loyally
stand bj- our comamnder-in-chief
in war and with equal loyalty sup
port him in the negotiations of a
just peace, and that in the new
world upon which we shall enter
after the war. its principles will af
ford .us a safer guidance in solving
the great problems that will come.”

descendants have figured prominent
ly in the making of Gardiner history
for a period of nearly 150 years. Da
vid Lawrence purchased 160 acres
of land in the Kennebec valley,
which was heavily timbered with
pine and oak. After building a home
lie began the lumber business which
has since and still remains in the
Lawrencp family. In these days most
of the timber was disposed of to the
shipbuilders of Bath. He left 14
children. On his death his son Charles
succeeded him in business and
branched out into the making of
staves and shingles. He became an
expei t in estimating logs and sold
vast quantities from properties he
had acquired in Jerusalem township.
In 1832 he built for the log driving
company in South Gardiner the larg
est and finest boom on the Kennebec.
He died at llie age of 80 in 1883. leav
ing 11 children.
Charles Lawrence was succeeded
by his five sons, Sherburn, Samuel,
Hiram. Greenlief and Charles, Jr.
The first mill of tho present extensive
plant was then constructed and the
•business greatly enlarged. The five
brothers were also extensively en
gaged in the harvesting of ice and
three large houses for this purpose
were constructed by them.
Tlie partnership was first broken
by the death of Samuel Lawrence in
1888 and Sherburn Lawrence, the el
dest of the remaining brothers, as
sumed charge. He became postmaster
of South Gardiner and served in the
city government. He died in 1895.
Charles, Jr., W'as associated with
Greenlief and at the time of his
death in 1901, he was serving as a
member of the Maine Legislature. On
the incorporation of the business
Greenlief Lawrence was made pres
ident of the concern, and his son,
Harry B. Lawrence, secretary and
treasurer.
The concern had vast holdings in
the Moosehead lake and Dead River
regions and for many years from 8 to
10 million feet of logs were cut an
nually, which required a force of be
tween 200 and 300 men and 50 teams
each winter in the woods. At the
South Gardiner mills the force em
ployed has reached as high as 110
men.

Basket. Clark, Pickford, Castle,
Dalton, Hyland, Meighan and Oth
ers
This week opens the biggest pro
gram ever offered at he cozy old
Johnson Opera House. First on the
list is clever little Marguerite Clark.
It wasn't necessary for lightning to
staike twice in the same place in
""Out of a Clear Sky!"" It struck
right in the bull's-eye the first time
and cemented the Belgian Princess
and the American Citizen in the
bond of matrimony.
You see. Marguerite Clark had to
leave her tiny kingdom in Belgium
when the Prussian Huns defiled tier
country. So she came to America
and w-hen she was walking through
a mountain gorge a Holt of lightning
popped out of a clear sky and “intro
duced” her to her future husband.
Miss Clark is supported by Thomas
Meighan and a special cast of artists.
The balance of the Hill includes the
""First Law"" with Trene Castle (Mrs.
Vernon Castle) and the Pathe News.
This makes a bill of eleven reels in
all. As stated before this is the
banner week of the whole season and
certainly the first two days should
please all patrons of this theatre.
Same small prices.—Adv.

William Desmond in “Closing In”;
the Retreat of the Germans Shown
in the “Allies’ War Review”, Pre
sented by the U. S. Government,
and Triangle Comedy
It took some brave lad to do what
Jack Brandon did. and after many
months, when Barbara Carlton be
lieved him all that was had and
crooked, she saw the light in a rather
peculiar way. You see Jack loved
Barbara, and so naturally when he
found the girl's father trying to com
mit suicide he determined to save
him. And so he took on his own
shoulders the guilt which belonged
to the older man, and disappeared.
Then he became a member of the
Northwest Mounted Police. And then
—William Desmond is the young
hero and Maude Wayne is the girl.
The retreat of the Huns is shown

SKOWHEGAN
An audience of interested Skow
hcgan people gathered at the State
Reformatory for Women, Friday af
ternoon to be present at the flag rais
ing at tlie Lillian M. N. Stevens cot
tage. The. administration room on
the east was occupied by the audi
ence and here speech making was
in order ■with the superintendent,
Mrs. Gertrude Wight, presiding. She
explained that the inmates had
planned to obtain a flag and earn
money for the same, hut instead they
had been presented with the Stars
and Stripes by Mrs. Mary Burnham
of Portland, who is greatly interest
ed in the institution. Mrs. Burnham '
was invited to bo present but being
unable to come she forwarded a
lengthy telegram which embodied al
so a charming little poem, the same
being read by Mrs. Wight. Clyde II.
Smith of Skowhegan, chairman of the
board of trustees, was called upon
for the opening address and he ex- j
pressed liis delight at seeing so many
of the citizens present on this occa
sion, adding that the feeling of an
tagonism felt by some, in the begin- j
ning, that the institution was to come
to Skowhegan had entirely died out.
He especially addressed the women
of the institution, trusting that they
might gain a better understanding
for a more satisfactory life’ and then
referred to the American flag which
was to be hoisted over Stevens Cot
tage. Mrs. Effie M. Lawrence of
Rockland, another trustee, was then
called upon and she very charming
ly admitted that while she at first
thought Skowhegan was not the place
at all for the state institution she
had grown to see that this was not
the case. She gave a very patriotic ■
address voicing special sentiments to
the women, a large number of whom
were grouped at the rear of the room
to listen to the exercises. Mrs.
Lawrence also added that in her
opinion many of the women would
not now be inmates of the reform
atory had it not been for the war,
the changes and the bewilderment
resulting therefrom being largely re
sponsible for their mistakes. Mrs.
Frances E. Damon of Dexter, a third
member' of the board addressed her
remarks almost entirely to the wo
men in which expressions from
Longfellow, motherly advice and pa
triotism were intermingled with sin
cere fervency. Other Speakers who
responded with kind and eloquent
remarks when called upon were R. T.
Patten, Edward F. Merrill, Rev. O.
H. Tracy, Rev. George Merriam and
Rev. Charles II. McElhiney. The
tina> speaker om the afternoon was
Fr. Keeley of Lewiston of the board
of commissioners. Patriotism might
well be considered the keynote of this
address, particularly' fitted to the
prime motive of the meeting, the
raising of the Stars and Stripes. He
urged with great earnestness that we
“follow the dictates of our con
science and worship Almighty God.""
Like his predecessors he gave special
attention to the inmates, “the girls
who came there to improve them
selves.”
At this point in the program Supt.
Wight announced that a drill would
be executed by some of the girls and
the big folding doors which divide
the Administration room were thrown
open and some thirty young women
executed a difficult drill in which the
various nations were represented.
Each girl wore an elaborate gown
made of crepe paper by the inmates
and their assistants and national an
thems of various countries were
sung.. The drill was unusually in
tricate but not one false move was
made and it is seldomer a handsomer
group of young women may be found
together at one time. At the end of
the ijrill a dainty young lady
crowned as the goddess of Liberty
appeared and, escorted by the re
maining members of the cast, bore
the flag to the outside of the build
ing, where she assisted Chairman
Clyde H. Smith of the Reformatory
Board in hoisting the emblem of
liberty. The girls pledged allegiance
to the flag after it had been raised
and one of their number stepped to
the front and charmingly recited a
tribute to the flag. *
At the conclusion of the exercises
tfeb -vMtom were allowed to Inspect
the bttlMing and the remainder of
the time was spent socially. It wa«
an example indeed not only cf the
great effort being made to improve
the mental and moral conditions of
the unfortunate women of our state
but of the ability of Mrs. Wight as
the leader of such an institution.

Gardiner 7, Skowhegan 3
The football game played liere
Saturday by the Gardiner High and
Skowhegan High school teams was
won by the down river players by
a score of 7 to 3 but it was a hard
fight and everybody was on their
toes from start to finish. There were
no particular stars for every man
on both sides was a star. Simmonds
got tile touchdown for Gardiner and
Bisson picked field goal for Skowhe
gan. Skowhegan held Gardiner for
downs at two different times within
a few feet of the Skowhegan goal an.l
the defensive playing of Skowhegan
might well be termed another fea
ture of the game. Owing to bod i
weather, the epidemic, etc., the foot- I
ball team this year has played but |
little. Out of three games played i
this is the first the local boys have !
lost, having won Saturday before !
last, at Wilton by a score of 7 to 6 ;
in a game with 'Wilton Academy. 1
The Wilton players come to Skow- ;

Troubled Two Years.
HEALED BYCUTICURA
SOAP AND OINTMENT
""When I was about fourteen years of
age I began to get pimples and black
heads, snd my face and neck were cov
ered. The pimples were red and came
to a head making me look awful. They
itched so that when I scratched they got
so hard and red I could not sleep with
the pain.
‘‘I had the trouble for most two years
before I used Cuticura Soap and Oint
ment, and after using three cakes of
Cuticura Soap and one fifty^ent box
of Cuticura Ointment I was healed.""
(Signed) Miss AgnesHaleks. Pleasant
View Ave., Bristol, Conn., Oct. S, ’17.
Some think that because Cuticura
does such wonderful work in soothing
and healing severe eczemas it is not
adapted to toilet usee. But that is just
where it is most effective in preventing i
little skin troubles becoming serious.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Does the federal migratory bird law
now aet a bag limit on the various species
of game birds or can 1 go by the State law
as to this?
Yes. You must observe the federal
regulations. A copy will be mailed to
you free by the Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C., upon request.
Have just ret urned from a hunting trip
alter prairie chickens. My companion
had much better luck than I. We decided
it was due to the difference in the size of
shot we used. What size would you
recommend?
For wild birds, especially if shooting
in cover, sixes. No. 7 and No. 7% are
used, the latter in much larger volume
than the former, because they are the
standard size used for trap shooting and
shells containing them are almost always
to be had. But between 7% and 6 shot,
we would choose the latter, and chilled,
of course.
Cana round bail be used in a 20 gauge
shotgun with safety, and what size ball in
a full choke barrel? Where can I get in
formation regarding this kind of a load?
The leading manufacturers of am
munition load 20-gauge sheila with a
round, solid ball and two drama of smoke
less powder. There is only one size ball
loaded by each manufacturer, and it will
“work” satisfactorily in a choke-bored
gun. In the brand with which the writer
is familiar this ball for the 20 is .545
caliber and weighs about % ounce, or
28% to the pound, which means it is about
28% gauge.

AUGUSTA LOCALS
Charles H. Marston of Gardiner
was admitted Friday to the Augus
ta General hospital for medical treat
ment.
H. W. Sanborn, who has been con
fined to his bed for the past week
with a mild attack of influenza, was
■able Friday to sit up for awhile.
The November meeting of the Hos
pital Aid will he held at 2.30 this
Saturday afternoon with Mrs. Joseph
Williamson, 53 Grove street.
Friends of Miss Lillian Coleman of
this city, who a short time ago un
derwent surgical treatment at the
Augusta General hospital, will be
pleased to learn that she is reported
to be doing well.
A West Paris letter in the Lewis
ton Sun of Nov. 22 says that ""Dr.
O'Connor of Augusta, an army sur
geon, who was here during the worst
of the epidemic, started overseas In
12 hours after leaving here.” As Dr.
O'Connor is still at his home in Au
gusta and is one of the busy surgeons
of the city, it is probable that the
West Paris writer was misinformed.
'^Getting the most out of the price
you pay"" there’s a way to do that in
everything you have to buy. In
clothes it is a guaranteed fact, that
the long wear and satisfactory serv
ice you obtain from one or Hart
Schaffner & Marx overcoats, results
j in your having paid a low price in
' the beginning for the garment.

chief at Webster Camp
Warren Thomas, aged 18 years, was
arraigned at 4 o’clock Friday after
noon before Judge Lancaster of the
municipal court to answer to a
charge of malicious mischief, the
charge arising from the ""shooting
up'* a short time ago of a camp
owned by S. C. Webster of this city
and located on his woodlot near Riv
erside Drive, mention of which was
made in Frtday morning's Journal.
Thomas pleaded not guilty, and
during the progress of the hearing it
was learned that Merle Ellis and
Eraest Hawes, each aged 14 years,
were at the camp at the time that
the damage was done to the build
ing and its contents. It was learned
that during the presence of the boys
at the camp, in addition to other
damage done, in which was included
the breaking of a stove and a mirror,
two bedspreads were later found to
have'become mildewed because of
having been wet by rain having come
in upon them.
I The estimated damage to the camp
I and its contents wis set at *21. and
in disposing of the case Thomas was
ordered to pay the sum of $9. Ellis a
like sum. and Hawes 88. Ellis paid at
the time of the hearing and the other
two boys have promised to pay
shortly.

NOVELTY NIGHT OFFERING
Three Fine Features Engaged for Big Event
—Last Season’s Popular Program Excelled
—Something to Please Every Taste
T!ie Novelty Night program for this
season's Augusta Entertainment
Course promises to excel last season's
offering which was considered by
many to be the best feature of the
former series.
In addition to Miss Edna Howland,
a lyric soprano whose singing never
fails to create enthusiasm, two com
plete entertainment companies,
neither of which have before ap
peared except for an entire evening s
entertainment, have been engaged
and will present the cream of their
specialties in a two hour program
which for novelty and genuine enjoy
ment has probably never been
equalled in this city.
Signor Omero Castellucci. the direc
tor of the Neapolitans, is one of the
best band leaders in America. His
work is magnetic, spectacular and
dynamic in the extreme, remind
ing one of that of Creatore. He
is a finished musician who loves his
art, and inspires his*players to such
an extent that his singing band-or
chestra of eight people produce the
volume of music of a regimental
band.
It is a jaded musical taste, indeed,
that will not find enjoyment in thu
Neapolitans’ music. Every member
is a sterling artist capable of filling
important solo parts. Twenty-two
different kinds of instruments are
used by these thoroughly alive and
versatile musicians, included in the
numbers of their popular and varied
program are solos, duets and quar
tets of all kinds, band and orchestra
selections, side-splitting impersona
tions of leading band masters and
many novelties .
The other big feature for Ihe even
ing will be the Great Davis, master
American magician, and company.
Davis presents one strange thing
after another with fun all the while.
He is the fastest wmrking magician
before the public and will include in
the program his “Escape Mystery.”
1 a. most sensational and unusual act.
! Davis is the leader of leaders and
| presents only superlative magic.
Goodrich-Newell
i Earl E Goodrich and Madeline Xew
j ell of Hallowell were united in marriage
at 2 o'clock Thursday afternoon at the
home of Charles Chase, 13 East Cres
cent street in this city, Rev. W. J.
Layton of the Green street Methodist

Allies Must Help to
Make Austrian Republic
Vienna, Sunday. Nov. 21.—(By the As
sociated Press).—Provided the Allies,ex
tend immediate help, the Austrian re
public will be able to arise from the po
sition it is in at present, said Dr. Jos
eph Redlich, former minister of finance,
to the correspondent today.
“We hope there is no revengeful de
sire on the part of the Allies to see us
remain in poverty,"" he continued. ""Our
enemies should be generous and remem
ber, at least, that Austria did what she
considered her duty to her ally and
tried repeatedly to give up the war. If
we are helped we will be able to help
ourselves. Our people are farmers and
men of the industrial classes, all will
ing to work and not inclined to Bo’
shevism. Our financial position looks
like bankruptcy on paper, but we are
able to pay our war debts.
""Our gold reserves are small—perhaps
half a million crowns—but that is of
no great importance, in my opinion.
What I urge is that we be helped back
to a productive basis. If we can get
food now we will be able to keep order.
If we can get coal we will begin work
ing. If we can get cotton, metals and
raw materials, production will go on.
| We will also be quiet politically, which
; is desired by America and the Allies.
Whether we are tied up to the German
i federation or not is an unsettled ques
i tion, even among ourselves. It is my
| opinion that we must form a federation
; with the broken up parts of the former
j empire for commercial purposes.”

Austrian Child-Slaves
The report of a parliamentary com
mittee appointed to investigate condi
tions surrounding child labor in Aus
tria discovered a most deplorable
condition, according to the Arbeiter

; gaged in some kind of work. In some
! districts all the children of school age
arc working. Out of every 100 school
children between six and eight years.
18 are at work: between nine and ten,
35; between eleven and twelve, 50,
and between thirteen and fourteen,
52. Two-fifths of these children have
been working from the time they
were five or six years old.
Soldiers Learning Engilsh
It has been discovered that there
are thousands of men in our Na

demand for books, and even “First

asked for and—of course—supplied.

ITALY NEEDS MORE '
SUPPLIES THIS MONTH
Rome, Monday. Xov. 23.—The epidemic
of grippe in Italy during September, Oc- ]
tober and November added to the diffi- j
eulties of the food supply. Dr. Silvio
Crespi, the food minister, declared in
the Chamber of Deputies today in a
statement regarding the food situation.
During this period, lie stated, about
one-third of the personnel of the rail
ways have been victims of the malady,
complicating the situation just at a
time when the Italian offensive was In
progress and the effective transporta
tion of supplies through efficient rail
way service was indispensable. The re
maining railway men, however, by re
doubling their efforts had succeeded in
making up the deficiency in labor.
This winter, the minister said, Italy
needs more supplies than she did last
year, as she must feed the reconquered
provinces of the kingdom and the re
deemed territories in addition. There
were also more than 1,000,000 Austrian
prisoners, making a total of about 5,
000.000 more mouths to feed.
Signor Crespi expressed the hope that
the inter-allied food and tonnage com
mittees would continue to work satis
factorily and that at a meeting with
Herbert C. Hoover, the American food
administrator, now in Europe, an ar
rangement would be arrived at to meet
the situation. He added that the ex
pectation was that within a year the
tonnage of the world would be doubled,
causing a great reduction in shipping
rates and consequently lower prices for
food.

associated with the functions of the

now for centralization cf the work. Be
fore leaving for Europe to undertake

Holland Is very busy making final !
arrangements. The journey from ;
Amsterdam to London would take;
but one and one-half or two hours.
The Dutch military airmen, who
have been in training since the be-1
ginning of the war, are to act as pilots
and the ministry of war is lending
full co-operation to the scheme. On
the same lines an air service between
Amsterdam and Groigen Is also being

j tions indicate, they will not be found

WANTED: OPENINGS FOR
RETURNING SOLDIERS
The U. S. Employment Service, Au
gusta, Maine, has received the follow
ing letter from the Sawyer Boot &
Shoe Co., Bangor:
""We hold ourselves in readiness to
use soldiers who are crippled and in
capacitated. for certain lines of work
in our moccasin department, the work
being hand sewing. Any person who
has lost one or more limbs might be
able to do this work, and we will be
glad to co-operate with your department
in doing anything we can to give reg
ular employment to such men.""
The U. S. Employment Service asks
the co-operation of every-firm, manu
facturing industry, mercantile business
house and any other person or concern
•who can and does hire any number of
men, to assist in the finding of employ
ment for our boys when they return
home. The employment service during
war times proved its worth by taking
care, sin a large measure, of all labor
demands throughout the country. Now
that the entire labor situation has
changed, the employment service must
develop to meet the strain put upon It.
It can do it best if It is bulwarked and
strengthened by every element in the
community. This It asks of the citizens
of Augusta and vicinity. It is a na
tional organization and it is operated
for the special benefit of no group or
faction of society. It Is neither the In
strument of a labor movement, nor the
tool of large concerns. It is, and it will
continue to be, solely an agency of the
whole American people.
A State-wide survey of labor condi
tions is now being taken by this ser
vice. This is being done ir. order to have
a concise and accurate record of all la
bor needs throughout the State. Each
employer is being asked to keep the
office of the service informed as to the
number of men he can use from day to
day, so that when the boys return and
apply they can be directed to a job
without further delay.

INFLUENZA MORE
DEADLY THAN WAR
WASHINGTON.—The recent epi
demic of influenza caused more
deaths in the United States than oc
curred among the American expedi
tionary forces from all causes from
the time the first unit landed in
France until hostilities ceased, the
census bureau announced. The
statement was based on unofficial
estimates of the total casualties
among oversea forces and reports
from 46 cities in America, having a
combined population of 2S.OOO.OOO.
The latter showed 82.306 deaths from
Influenza and pneumonia from Sep
tember 9 to November 9.
Census Bureau Says
Epidemic Caused 82,306
Deaths In One Month I
Disease Quite Likely
to Return
■While the recent grip epidemic appears to have ended, doctors agree
that it is quite likely to return and In fact there have already been re
newed outbreaks of the disease In various cities. -
If you catch cold, don’t take chances by neglecting it because it is more
than likely to develop into grip or pneumonia. Begin at once taking Fa
ther John’s Medicine which has had over sixty years of success for colds
and in the building of new strength to resist disease.
But if you have had the grip you are still in danger.
The getting-well stage of grip is the most dangerous of all because the
body, weakened by the grip, is wide open to attacks of other lurking dis
ease germs.
That is why all the organs of the body must be kept in their best work
in* order, not only to drive out the poison left by the grip germ, but that
the patient stall regain strength as soon as possible to avoid further at
tacks resulting from the poisons in the system
After the grip Father John’s Medicine builds up the body because it is
all pure wholesome nourishment and free from opium, morphine, chloro
form or other poisonous drugs or alcohol.—Adv.

Zee Peterson Pettengill
A Appreciation
The many friends of Mrs. Charles
S. Pettengill will feel a deep sense of
personal loss at her sudden and al
together unexpected passing away at
her late home on Sunday afternoon.
A tender sympathy goes out at once
from every heart in the whole com
munity to her family,—to those wrho
meant everything to her, and for
whom she did and gave so much. Ev
eryone who knew her loved her and
she will long be remembered by the
large company of those who prized
her as friend and comrade. She gave
herself unsparingly and with real sac
rifice In every activity which claimed
her interest.
Her sympathies were broad, and
her heart felt the'calls of need and
service and her response was instant
and sincere. She had a kind word
and a pleasant smile for all. and the
value of her life among her fellows
cannot be easily measured. The Win
throp St. Universalist church which |
she loved, and to which early in life •
she gave herself, testifies tq the worth
of her Christian character, and the
value of her unstinted service in all
its interests. Her faithful and sym
pathetic attendance upon its public
services, was an inspiration, and as
well her leadership in the organized i
work of the women of the parish was |
most productive in promoting not
only the material side but the true so
cial life of the church.
The great work of the Red Cross, at
the very outbreak of the war made 1
its appeal for service, which she in
stantly heeded, and her response was
hearty and constant to the very last. 1
Her work both in Augusta and at1
Squirrel Island, her summer home,!
for the Red Cross was made at a very
real sacrifice of time and strength.
The crowning sacrifice of her splen
did career is now complete, as passing
through the valley of shadows she
gives a new life to the world, one
who is to bear the name she honored,
and to whom as to all who knew and |
loved her she leaves the fruitful ex
ample of a noble character.

In One Night, While You Sleep
Mustarine Ends Sore Throat,
Cold on Chest, Pleurisi
Quickest Pain and Ache Killer on
Earth—Neuralgia. Backache,
Headache Go in 5 Minutes.
The minute you rub on Mustarine for
any pain, ache or soreness you’ll know
that all the misery, and agony has
started to go. It is very penetrating
and won't blister.
Any druggist anywhere, will recom
mend it; praise it; guarantee it. He
will tell you that a small box of this
wonderful discovery will do the work of
50 mustard plasters.

The w«in and Cozy Playhouse That
Knows and Shows you What you Want
to See in Photoplays.
The Great Nazimova, Thursday.
“Toys of Fate” is Mme. Nazimova’s
second great Screen Classics production,
a magnificent successor to “Revelation.”
In this vital, human document, the
celebrated Russian actress plays the
part of “Azah,” a gypsy princess, of
whom fate demands that she avenge the
wrong done her mother. The cup of love
is placed at Azah’s lips, only to be snatch
ed roughly away, and life seems to play
at cross-purposes with this true-hearted
little daughter of the Romany race.
Idyllic surroundings of great beauty form
the background for dynamic events of
dramatic power. Reward and recom
pense come to the gypsy girl when she
has offered her life to save another, and
destiny at last gives her the full measure
of happiness, so long withheld. There is
an unforgetable quality in “Toys of
Fate,” and in the superb work of the
great Nazimova as “Azah.” TheOfficial
War Pictures will be shown in addition to
“Toys of Fate,” Thursday only.
The Doctor and the Woman, Friday.
Mary Roberts Rinehart’s best seller,
“K” has been adapted to the screen with
the title, “The Doctor and the Woman,”
and the photoplay is fully as captivating
and thrilling as the famous novel. This
alone would be sufficient to ensure a fine
show and when added to this, two re
nowned stars, Mildred Harris (Mrs. Chas.
Chaplin) and True Uoardman (Stingaree,)
head the cast, something extra in the
way of entertainment may be expected.
“The Doctor and the Woman” is offered
one day only, Friday, matinee and even
ing. Other reels will also be shown.
Earl Williams, Saturday.
For the week-end show we have secured
a program suitable for young and old.
The feature, ‘‘An American Live Wire,”
is one of O. Henry’s lively stories of
South America, a story replete with sur
prising twists and gems of subtle humor.
Earle Williams, always a favorite, plays
the lead and you will enjoy watching him
inject some American pep into a Southern
country and recapture a stolen fortune.
Ore of the popular Luke comedies and
the Pathe News complete the bill.
Norma Talmadge, Monday.
From a would-be modern Cleopatra
trifling with Fate and forever in pursuit
of pleasure to an unselfish and devoted
woman wrapped up in hef two small chil
dren—that is the character transition
portrayed by the versatile Norma Tal
madge in her screen impersonation of the
heroine of ‘The Moth,” her newest
Selznick-Picture which is seen Monday.
Abounding in emotional possibilities and
dramatic incidents, the plot is calculated
to give the charming voung s'tar an op
portunity to add one more artistic inter
pretation to her already amazing list of
successes.
Norman Talmadge is a stranger to Bel
fast audiences, but we predict within a
few weeks she will be one of the best
known and best liked of the stars shown
at the Colonial.
Big Double Bill, Tuesday.
In addition to the regular attraction for
Tuesday which is “The Fair Pretender”
with Madge Kennedy and Tom Moore,
the excruciatingly funny two-reel com
edy, “The Geezer of Berlin” will be
shown.
In “The Fair Pretender” Madge Ken
nedy as Sylvia Maynard typifies all girls
who cherish stage ambitions, and what
girl has not at some time believed herself
destined for a career before the footlights?
With delightful fidelity she portrays the
hopes and fears of her heroine, never
dreaming that her eagerness to show her
employer—a theatrical manager, by the
wa>—how clever she is will be the means
of starting her a series of adventures far
more startling than ever befell a beginner
on the stage.
How the girl becomes mixed up with
the smart set; how she succeeds in pass
ing herself off as a dashing widow only
to be found out at the moment when all
her plans for the success of the man she
cares for are materializing—this is only
part of “The Fair Pretender,” a play
which enthralls and charms because of
its originality.
Do you want to see the kaiser baked in
an oven? Do you want to see it made so
hot for him that he is blown up through
the ceiling? That’s only one of the things
that happen to Little William A’Mighty
in “The Geezer or Berlin,” a travesty on
“The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin.”
Come and take a crack at the dignity
of the All Highest, make fun of him and
his silly son to your heart’s content. See
the German war lords, Von Turpentine
and Hmdenboig, ridiculed. See how the
Clown Quince started the war by con
ceiving an idea—the first idea he had ever
had. See how the baker of Louvain took
revenge and baked his royal crust to a
crisp. You can’t afford to miss “The
Geezer of Berlin”—Tuesday.
Tarzan of the Apes, Wednesday
The most amazing film production in
history is coming Wednesday, “Tarzan
of the Apes.” Shown on Broadway at
dollar prices, there will be no advance
here. See Tarzan. Follow the most
fascinating character the screen has ever
known in his travels through the jungles.
See his combats with lions, tigers, leop
ards, apes and gorillas. His struggle with
the giant cannibal. His ride on the ele
phant’s head in the raid on the natives
and his beautiful romance with the first
woman he ever saw. It startles, thrills,
amuses.
Albert Payson Terhune said: “It is the
greatest picture I ever saw.”
Pauline Fredericks said: “It is a won
derful picture.”
Evening World said: “Only one word
will describe it. It is marvelous.”
Evening Telegram said: “It thrills,
it astounds.”
Herald said: “More thrlts than Broad
way is used to.”
Willard Mack said; “It is a paster
piece of primeval life.”
The Times said: “It is thrilling and
educational.”
You will say: It startles—it thrills—it
astounds—it surprises and entertains.
NO TONIC LIKE HOOD’S
Sarsaparilla For a Time like This,
After Influenza, the Grip,
When pure blood, rebuilt strength
and regulated bowels are essential.
In the after-effects of influenza,
the grip and other prostrating dis
eases, Hood’s Sarsaparilla has re
markable health-helping effect.
It expels the poisons that have
weakened and depleted the blood,
causing pallor, anemia, flabby flesh
and lax muscles. It is the standard
blood remedy with a successful rec
ord of nearly fifty years.
Many people need a fine, gentle,
easy cathartic in these trying times.
We recommend Hood’s PUls, used in
the best families, and equally effec
tive with delicate women or robust
men.. Easy to take, easy to operate^
Our boys answered their country’s
call and no better soldiers fought on
the fields of France.
The deeds of this year will stand
out in the records of all time.
Although the fighting has now
stopped our Government needs the
War Savings Stamp money to bring
our boys safely home; the need today is
as great as before the Huns surrendered.
We have answered the call on all
campaigns, EXCEPT WAR SAV
INGS. To make the record complete
stamps to the value of $6,000,000 more,
must be bought.
In order to do this the week of
December 7-14, has been set aside as !
“Over the Top Week” in Maine on
War Savings Stamps. j

Interesting Case of Miss Baird
Sick Four Years, Red Cross Worker Tells
How She Goi Well
The case of Miss G. I. Baird of 30 Glen
vilie Avenue, Allston, Mass., may bring
new hope and health to other sufferers
who have stomach worms and do not
know what is the matter. A letter from
this sufferer tells the story:
“I have been sick almost two years,
had four doctors with little or no relief.
Some of the doctors said I had enlarged
liver, nervous indigestion, too much acid
in my system. I v\as so tired in the
morning it seemed as though I could not
get dressed and get to work. I was grow
ing thin every day, went from 138 to 111.
“I was so discouraged I didn’t know
what to do. One night about three weeks
ago, I picked up a paper and saw your Dr.
True’s Elixir, Family Laxative and Worm
Expeller, advertised. I made up my mind
I had worms and the next day bought a
small bottle of Dr. True’s Elixir and took
three teaspoonfuls until I had taken the
bcttle.
“I was surprised at the result, pin
worms, some a linger long so much
slime, some that looked as though it was
just the skin of worms. The days before
I took Dr. True’s Elixir I thought I
should go wild with the crawling in my
stomach, I could feel them. My stomach
was sour all the time and some days I
could not retain what I ate, while other
days, couldn’t keep anything on my stom
ach. I coughed so just the minute I went
to bed some nights I would not sleep more
than one or two hours. The second dose
stopped the crawling and the second night
I didn’t cough.
“I feel like a new person, all my friends
say 1 look so much better, but I don’t
need to have them tell me, for I know my
feelings. I wouldn’t have believed any
one could feel so much better in such a
short time. I tell everyone I know. I
can’t give your medicine praise enough.”

FLORENCE M. KIMBALL.
The sudden death of Miss Florence M.
Kimball of this city brought sorrow to
her relatives and a very large circle of
friends who loved and admired her for
the many traits of worthy womanhood.
She had been ill only a week, at her
rooms in the John E. Bowker residence
on upper High street, with influenza and
pneumonia followed by meningitis. Sev
eral weeks ago she was in Bath to care
for her brother Ivan and did not contract
the epidemic at that time, but later fell a
victim to it while engaged in the regular
duties as teacher of Grade IV in the Mc
Lellan school. Dr. Foster C. Small was
in attendance and called Dr. Eugene D.
Tapley in consultation. Two trained
nurses from Bangor were also employ
ed. Miss Kimball was born in Swan
ville Aug. 25, 1885, the daughter of
the late Daniel J. and Ada (Philbrick)
Kimball. The family moved to the Head
of the Tide when the deceased was a
young girl. There she graduated from (
the High school and later graduated
from the Castine Normal school, taking j
teaching as a profession for which she |
had an aptitude. After teaching for.
a few terms at Bar Harbor, Monmouth
and in the Primary grade she came to '
Grade IV on the Common, and when the ,
McLellan school building was in readi
ness was transferred there. This is the !
first death in the Belfast teaching force !
since the death of the deceased cousin, j
Miss Edna L. Piper on Jan. 21, 1877. j
Miss Kimball was a member of the North j
Congregational Church and its allied so- '
cieties. She was a charter member of
John Cochran Chapter. D. A. R., was its
secretary and was to have been assistant !
hostess of its meeting arranged to have '
taken place on the night of the day of I
her death. She was past president of
Emma White Barker Tent, D. of V., was '
a member of Thomas H. Marshall Circle,
of Aurora Rebekah Lodge, I. O. O. F., of
Seaside Chautauqua Circle and of the j
Teachers’ Associations. She is survived
by three sisters and one brother, Mrs. j
Harriet K. Adams of Lynn, Mass., Mrs. !
Winnifred K. Holmes of Waldo, Ivan |
Kimball of Belfast and Mrs. Ruth K.
Brown of Lowell, Mass., by a half-sister,
Mrs. Lizzie K. Ellis of EasJ Belfast, and
a half-brother, John Kimball of Belfast.
One aunt, Mrs. Vina Kimball Philbrick
of East Belfast, also a cousin who held
the relationship of sister, Mrs. Etta Piper
Savery of East Belfast. The funeral
will take place to-morrow, Friday at I
o’clock.
The A. T. W. Club held its semi
monthly meeting at the home of the
teacher, Mrs. Clarence E. Read, last ;
Monday afternoon. The lives of the
composers, Bach and Handel, were dis- .
cussed and a lesson in harmony given,
after which piano solos were rendered by
Miss Barbara McKenney, Miss Charlotte
Knowlton and Mrs. Read. The club plans
a comprehensive course in musical his- I
tory and the rudiments of harmony dur- 1
ing the winter. The meetings will be 1
held the first and third Mondays in each '
month. ’
Red Cross Notes.
Sweater knitters are much needed. II
is necessary that we should feel just as
j responsible for Red Cross work now as
during the days of actual hostilities, for
supplies are just as much needed. Please
do not let your interest in any phase of
the work flag. There is a great deal of
sewing on hand and room for all to help
in the new quarters in Memorial Hall.
No more scrap-books will be needed after
the present consignment has been sent.
Mr. Charles Bickford has done very
efficient work in connection with the
Christmas boxes, seventy-seven of which
he has shipped to our boys overseas.
Mr. Cecil Clay has been appointed
Chairman for the Christmas Red Cross
Membership Drive Dec. 16-23. He has
organized every town in the county.
Owing to bad travelling and other de
ays the linen shower has progressed
somewhat slowly and will be continued
during the week. The idea is to collect
linen from our reserve stock in so far as
possible, instead of buying new, thus
serving the two-fold purpose of saving
us from one of the many demands for
money, and saving the mills the burden
of an additional order at a time when
they are so much behind in articles of
this nature. Will collectors and any who
have not been personally called on, please
leave their donations at Memorial Hal ?
At the monthly meeting held at the
City National Bank last Tuesday after
noon the secretary pro tern, Mrs. E. P.
Carle, read the following list of officers
for the Chapter, which were re-elected:
Chairman, Miss Louise Hazeltine; vice
chairman, Miss Maude E. Mathews; sec
retary, Mrs. J. C. Durham; treasurer,
Miss Isabel Ginn; chairman civilian re
lief, Miss Mathews; conservation, Miss
Annie L. Barr; finance, Rev. A. E. Wil
son; Junior Red Cross, Mrs. J. R. Dun
ton. The executive committee confirm
ed the appointment of the following Jun
ior Red Cross School committee, E. E.
Roderick, Miss A. L. Barr, Mrs. C. M.
Craig, Misses Alberta Wadsworth, Fran
ces Sargent and Mrs. Sarah Knight. A
vote of thanks was extended to the Sav
ings Bank, the City National Bank and
Thomas H. Marshall Post for the use of
their rooms. A new financial arrange
ment was read and adopted by which,
after Dec. 1st, all material required by
Chapters for production orders will be
supplied without charge. This will allow
the Red Cross to continue Droducing fin
ished articles, and at the same time to
carry on the work of civilian relief.
The U. S. Transport George Washing
ton which is taking President Wilson on
ais historic mission to Europe has on ;
joard a representative from Belfast I
Captain Wm. V. Pratt, U. S. N., gors|

Hk That p-rsoaal property exist
ing April 1st. about to be rectoved
f:om town before the new taxes have
been Mnamted, shall be subject to
an immediate tax figured by the rate
ftf the previous year, the same to be
paid before the removal of the goods
or chattel property from the town.
fth. Whereas under the practice of
certain mercantile dealers, particu
larly the dealers in coal p&iroleum
oil, and its products, dispose of their
goodp, wares and merchandise yearly
in the course of trade prior to the 1st
day of April, whereby a just ana
equitable valuation for purposes of
assessment of taxos by the local as
sessors is made impossible.
Be it resolved, in this second as
sessors' convention assembled, that
the president and secretary thereof
Be hereby instructed to prepare and
submit to the next Legislature to be
held at Augusta, in and for t^e State
ai Maine, a bill for the correction of
this defect in our taxation system.
Dr. A. 0, Thomas. School Department
The first of the speakers of the fore
noon representing the six state depart
ments was Or. A u. Thomas, State su
perintendent of public schools. In open
ing h:s address he said that we speak
pf reconstruction, but there are only
a lew things to be reconstructed. With
the returning of millions of men t»
their work there will be a reconstruc
tion of government and society. The
government will be a more pure democ
racy. Ar.d there will be a reconstruc
tion of industrial ar.d commercial life.
Th.s reconstruction as it pertains ta
ith* school was described by Br. Thom
as. who said that the schools huge not
been demolished, although they have
been interfered with to some extent.
The reconstructions means one of edu
cational ideals. There is a small per
centage of people of U;e United States
who are college men and if they were
to become the rulers of this country it
would be an educational aristocracy.
And that i^ust r.ot appear However,
the knowledge of elementary facts jviU
not do for the future A seconderv ed
ucation represented by high schools
will be needed. The boys and girls must
aid a story to their edticai ao to meet
lbs ntcessit.es of the future
The United State government now
feels that it has a res; onsibifity .-i the
development rad budding up of the
s ates. The 1 res.den: b^s rec-ontmend
ed greater road building m t'r. s coun
try even on toads extending to the very
rural sections. The United States pro
poses the Hose Smith bill ly provide
0»*,{iCv for sthpois. If the 1 :2‘ passes
Jl.»8 will come to the State of Maine
for *the support of Us schools
. Ur. Thomas in closing his address
stated that the department cf educa
tion wanted the co-operation of ail to
rssist In every way to prouu-e the best
system of schools that can be produced.

The commission must make its re
port to tile towns on or before Feb.
J&. The ac'qon of ti e town shall be
reported to the oommissidh by the

Regarding mnir.tenar.ee. he stated
that before the present State high
way law was passed there was prac
tically r.o maintenance. During tr.e
past year there were over 42bu miles

The next speaker was Hoc. John A
Rubens, commissioner of agriculture,

measures and plant pests
Commissioner Roberts tr >d of the
ease of a hard working woman wiu
was keeping a boarding huuse and
found she was not making it pay.
Finally she was obliged to sell thy
business and the man who bought
it was very careful and weighed the
meats and other things he purchased.
He found that there was trouble wiia
the grocers scales, ar.d the former
owner of the boarding house had no!
been getting ter money’s worth and
did not know it.
The duties of the local sealers of
weights and measures were pointed {
out by Mr. Ho her 19. who i-aid that ,
each town must own its own stan
dards for the Ujju of the sealer of
weights and measures The stan
dards are tested at the Hiatt House
opce in five years. Tuc pro,cut Htcfo
standards were bought six year* ag°

Eupop can corn barer which was in
troduced into Massachusetts a few ,
years ago ar.d is this year a menace :
tr. the grain industry of Xew England ;
and ttje entire country An appropria
tion is to be asked from Congress to,
eradicate this pest. Mr. Roberts spoke }
regarding the fight against the;
frown-tail moth, the gypsy moth

Han. Geo. W. Norton ef Governor's
Council
Hon. Geo. \V. Norton of Portland, a
meat tier of Gov, Slilakc-n's Council,
was the next speaker, talking upon
the subject of ""Soldier'll Awt'* He
shewed that towns must give potifi
catioa when soldiers return because
of the fact that when the soldiers are
discharged the aid to dependents
ceases. And he spoke of the matter
of continued aid for families of men

Afternoon Session
Tile speaker at the afternoon ses
sion was K. A. I.yerson, chairman
of the Board of Assessors of the city
cf Auburn. % nose subject w as ""Tbe
Assessor on the Job."" In his talk he
cbalt m an admirable manner with
the duties and questions that con
Ciiii the .niportant work in which
the .as.'css .rs are engaged. Mr. Ky
erscin said in part:
The complex life of our time with
its manifold forms of business and
industrial activity, bungs to the as
sessor many new items c-f personal
pr tporty which in earlier years were
never dreamed of. To bx fair values
on many of these is not easy, without
an inventory, which often is difheuit
to obtain. The aid of the owner, if
since.c. is invaluable. I have found
that a careful inquiry among the
minor industries in my city has re
sulted in finding valuable properties
for assessment.
The assessment of tbe large man
ufacturing concerns, business and
public service corporations, is a most
serious and interesting question.
These corporations form the basic
industries of the communities where
they exist. Their prosperity is vital
to the lif- of every community Inter
est. The value of all other property
holdings is made more valuable by
their presence Recognizing every
»• rvice big business renders, yet the
plain evidence of great prosperity in
so many instances, ar.d the apparent
opulence of owners, justify a most
careful inquiry into values, and the
endeavor to adjust the burden of tax
at ir. so that its imposition shall be
equitable.
1 cannot refrain from expressing to
if the experience of other states, so
ably and elaborately set forth by ffoc
P,. G. Mclntire before the Assessors*
Convention a year ago. we may have
legislation which will allow tpe tax
ing of intangibles in a more scientific
and satisfactory manner. 1 believe
it wculd result in iargely increased
revenue end reach holdings which
now hear no part of the burden of
taxation
Mr. Ryersqns address was followed
ty an ir.terestir.s discussion of many
important points relating to the du
ties of the assessors.
The conference was finally ad- ;
journed shortly before 5 P. M.
Resolutions Adopted
The folioSuns resolutions presented
by <1. W Q. Perham of Wood stock
were adopted by the convention:
Whereas It Is probably true that;
never in the history of our Suite was
so much money required t* keep

and
Whereas by the provisions of pgr

The Crowning Achievement
The General tells a dramatic story
of this mighty battle in three dis
tinct phrases, beginning on the night
of Sept. 27. when Americans quick
ly took the places of the French on
the thinly held line of this long
quiet sector. The attack opened on
Sept. S and the Americans drove
through entanglements, across No
Mac's-Land to take ail tha enemy a
first line positions. Closing the
chapter. General Pershing says: ;
‘‘On November 6 a division of the
first corps reached a point on the •
-Meuse opposite Sedan, 25 miles from ,;(
our line of departure. The strategi
I cal gc<al which was our highest hope
was pained. We had cut the en
emy's main line of communications,
and nothing but surrender or an
armistice could save h:s army from

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET
Features of the Day’s Dealings in All
the Leading Stocks
New York, Dec. 6.—Trading in the
stock market today, the dullest session
of several weeks was again limited lo
specialties, notably tobaccos, at extreme
, advances of one to live points.
The movement in that quarter was
traceable to professional interests and
derived its impetus from a revival of
rumors suggesting a combination or
merger of the better known manufac
turers and producers,
j Irregular advances were exhibited by
other specialties such as Beet Sugar.
American Linseed. Cotton and pre
j ferred Studebaker and American Wool

; publication of the declaration of the

I eral of tiie low priced western and
southern issues, and steels, coppers and
oils fluctuated within irregular limits.
Shippirg favored the long account al
tlioughs Marines rallied towards the
close in connection with rumors of un
foreseen obstacles to the proposed sals
of the company's British tonnage to
the United States government. Sales
amounted to 2S5.000 shares. Aside from
the retention of regular dividends by the
leading metal producers and a slight
easing ot call money there was little
in the day's news to stimulate public
or outside interest.
The investment market for further
unsettled by a continuance of the heavy
jelling of Liberty bonds, the tax-exempt
iljs falling to 97.50. a decline of 5 per
cent, for the year's best, while the
Fourtli 4 1-is established yet another
minimum of 95.90. Total sales, par

Bradstreet's Report
New York, Dec. 6 —Bradstreet s to
morrow will say:
Uncertainty savored, however, with
optimism, accompanied by a manifestly
slower gait in actual movements and
additional cancellations of war orders,
epitomized trade conditions.
vjr. ping for tangible tendencies, spec
ulating as to the course of price fixing
from war to peace work, and year-end
stock-taking, occupy most all of the
larger lines. Underneath the pause,
preparations to send salesmen on the
toad after the turn of the year are go
I ing on. Immediate demand, light as it
‘ is. overshadows buying for future ac
1 count, thus indicating a disposition to
, a-, ait developments while covering cur
• rent needs. On the other hand, retail
! trade at a number of centers is of large
i volume. Thanks chiefly to holiday pur
I chases, these being stimulated by the
| cheerful feeling arising out of the ter
i mination of the war and. to a large ex
; tent, to reduced prices on other than
holiday goods.

The International Sunshine society,
Goldenrod Branch, held a meeting in
the municipal court room Thursday
afternoon at which important business
was transacted. It was voted to discon*
tinue the organization as it existed an 1
to re-organize under the name of Skow
hegan Sunshine Society. The new so
ciety has become ihcorporatde and will
now act independently. The above step
was necessary in order to derive tl a
benefit from a sum of money left in
trust to the Skowhegar. Sunshine So
ciety by Mrs. Carolyn Redington, de
ceased.
The officers of the new organization
are as follows: Mrs. Mum Clough, pres
ident; Mrs. Ella Is. Jewett, vice presi
dent; Mrs. Minnie Wheeler, secretary;
Mrs. Elizabeth Nelson, treasurer.
This is one of the most worthy institu
tions in Skowhegan and should receive
the solid support of the citizens. Be
cause it is against the principles of this
society to advertise ts splendid work
among the needy, is perhaps the reason
why it receives such little attention.
This little band of good Samaritans de
serve more assistance and it is their
desire that all who wish will join the r
society. The dues are hut 25 cents a
year.
The Congregational church will ob
serve Every Member Canvass next Sun
day afternoon. Instead of depending
upon the generosity of those attending
to place enough money upon the pUU“s
to defray the expenses of the church,
the members meet at the end of the
year and discuss the budget for the
coming year. When this is made up a
copy accompanied by pledge cards is
sent to each family throughout the par
ish. On a designated Sunday the parish
is carefully canvassed and the pledges
taken up. The regular budget is the
same as last year, but there hr s been
an increase in the gross amount because
of the purchase of the parsonage.

FAMILIAR “ORIGI
NAL PACKAGES""
The famous “Original Package""
case of over 30 years ago wilt again
have an inning at the session of the
legislature, which will convene on
tin- first day of .lanuarj, as a resolve
in fuvyr of Michael Burns of Augus
ta will be presented during the.- first
week of the session by Uepresenta
tivc-elect Benedict I'. Maher of Au
gusta. The resolve is to re-imburse
Burns, who is now retired and living
in this city, for his expenses caused
by I lie seizure of his liquors at the
direct orders of the late Joseph It.
Bodwell. then the Governor of Maine.
Burns has applied to Legislature after
Legislature .with his claim but a set
tlement lias not as yet been adjusted.
In 1S87, Michael Burns, a veteran
of the Civil ""War. was engaged In the
liquor business in this city na the
proprietor of the “Modern Maine
Drug Store” at the north end of Wa
ter street in this city. At that time
the rum hunters were on the war
path. when Burns conceived the idea
that if liquor was imported Jo this
country and sold in the original pack
age that he could not be morested.
So Burns went to Liverpool and pur
chased several hundred cases of
whiskey. The whiskey was landed at
the port of Boston, transported to
Cortland in bonded cars and the duty
paid at the Cortland custom house.
Then the goods were shipped to Au
gusta and Burns began doing busi
ness.
Burns did a smashing business for
about 10 days and nearly every lawyer
in the county began looking up the law
on the matter, but they could find no
statute which declared that Burns
was not doing a legitimate business.
Joseph K. Rockwell of Hallowell
was Governor and he called Andrew
K. McFadden of Wuterville, at that
time the high sheriff of Kennebec
county, and Leroy T. Carleton of
Winthrop, then the county attorney,
to the executive chamber at the Stale
House and requested that Burns’ li
quor be seized in accordance with the
prohibitory liquor law of the State.
A warrant was sworn out by Coun
ty Attorney Carleton. and Sheriff Mc
l'adden made a seizure at Burns’
place, the late. Orville D. Baker of
Augusta, at that lime the attorney
t v
; general of Maine, representing the
: State at the preliminary hearing be
fore the late A. G. Andrews ol' the
Augusta municipal court, the lirsl and
only time in the history < the State
that an attorney gen' it 1 lias appeared
in a liquor case in the municipal
court. Burns was held for the su
perior court on the charge of main
taining a liquor nuisance. con
viction followed in the superior court
and the case was carried to the law
! court on exceptions.
I
“While the case was simmering in
■ the law court, an act was passed by
I Congress providing that all ferment
j cd. distilled or other intoxicating Ji
1 quor transported into any state or
! territory enacted in the exercise or
; its police powers, to the same extent
land in the same manner as though
; such liquors had been produced in
such state or territory, and shall not
be exempt by reason of being intro
duced therein in original packages or
otherwise.
Then followed the decision of the
Maine law court, declaring that Burns
at the time of the seizure was en
gaged in a legitimate business,
i Burns, who had moved to Boston.
: sued Sheriff MeFadden, in the United
: .States district court at Portland, for
: injuries caused by the seizure. The
i case was tried before the late Judge
I Nathan “Webb, and Sheriff MeFadden
I claimed that he was protected in his
I seizur* by his warrant. The late
I Patrick A. Collins of Boston, the late
William Henry Clifford of Portland
and the late Herbert M. Heath of Au
! gusta, counsel for Burns, contended
‘ that the warrant of the sheriff, Mc
i Fadden. read that the liquor seized
I v.ere Intended for illegal sale in this
I state, but as the law cour' of Maine
i had decided in favor of Burns. Me- ;
; Fadden exceeded his authority in tak
| ing the liquors. The decision at this
' time was against Burns and the mat- ■
! ter was appealed to the supreme court
of the United States, but was never
i pressed.
| Sheriff MeFadden. went to the Leg- ;
islature. and received reimbursement
fur the money which he expended m
| lighting the civil suit brought against
! him by Burns in the United States i
court. Bums claims that inasmuch as
McFaddcn 'was re-imbursed. he
should receive rc-imbursement.
At one session of the Legislature
an act giving Burns the right to
i bring a suit against the State in the
: courts was denied.
All the principals in this famdhs
case when Michael Burns for 10 days
| in a prohibition state openly sold
liquor with no law to reach him. with
the exception of Burns himself, Ex

of the Kennebec superior court at the
. time and Leroy T. Carleton of Win

Budget Estimates
The following budget estimates have
been tiled by State-aided institutions:
Holy Innocents Home top Infants
The Iloly Innocents Home for In

$2,000 for each of the years 1919 and
1320, according to a statement filed
Saturday at the otlicc of the State
auditor hv Right Itev. Louis-S. Walsh,

tion of $2,000 for each of the years 1917
and 191$ for this home.
The statement says that, the normal
capacity of the home is 20, but some
times there arc 25 and a waiting list.
The rate per week is from $2.50 to
$1.00 but often it is not possible to get
more than $1.00 a week. The stand
ard rate of 50 cents per day per per
son would jc the correct plan.

wages of all officers and employes, ex- |

central and west central divisions.
The winners of the pure bred dairy
calves are as follows:
In southern zone, .Ralph Lombard '
of Casco: in west central zone. Karl ‘

TALENTED ARTISTS
GREATLY ENJOYED
MONDAY EVENING
At Concert at City Hall
Which Opened Au
gUsta Entertainment
Course — Artists
Were Crawford
Adams, Violinist; Mr.
Bonelli, Baritone;
Mme. Corella, So
prano, and Miss
Breed, Humorist
Artists of wonderful ability de
lighted an audience that filled City
hall to its largest seating capacity
on Monday evening at the opening
entertainment of the Augusta Enter
tainment Course. All of tlje regular
patrons of the course were there and
many others from Augysta and near
by cities and towns, and it is safe
to say that in all that audience there
was not a single person who did not
feel more than satisfied with the ev
ening's entertainment.
It was certainly an unusual treat
that was offered music lovers in tills
vicinity to listen to four big artists
representing a combination of two
high grade companies, the artists be
ing: Crawford Adams, violinist: Ric
cardo Bonelli, baritone: Pauline Co
rella, soprano: and Roseth Knapp
Breed, humorist. The accompanists
were Adelaide Keezer and Nan Sy
nott.
I The concert was opened with a
• duet. “Wings of Music,” (Mendcls
! sohn). rendered by Mme. Corella and
Mr. Bonelli. After this selection
they rendered Duetto Buffo, ""Don
Pasquale.” (Donizetti), and gave as
an encore, “Duo de 1'Ana” from
“Veroniquc (Messager). These num
bers were especially delightful and
won great applause
Mrne. Corella then favored the
audience with two solos, “Come Be
loved” (Handel), and “Villanelle”
(dell ’Aequo), singing as an encore,
“Annie Laurie.-’ She is a very
beautiful w'man with an attractive
personality and her soprano voice
is of delightful quality and pure sil
ver tone. Indeed, the group of songs
she rendered will remain a most
pleasing remembrance for a long time
with those who heard her.
The songs rendered by Mr. Bonelli
during the evening were most enthu
siastically received, among these
numbers being Prologue from “Pag
liaoci” (Leancavallo), “The Rosary""
(Kevin), and Ballynure Ballard—Old
Iliish (arr. by Hughes). Mr. Ilonelli
as an exceptionally good baritone
voice, his singing is smooth and vcl
vetty and he s possessed of consider
able individuality. He knows how
to use his voice to best advantage
and his personality was revealed ex
ceptionally well in the songs. “Tim
Rooney’s at the Fighting” (Flynn),
and his encore, “The Lightning Bug ’
(Wells).
The other musical artist of the com
pany was Crawford Adams, a master
o' the violin. The audience was thrilled
by the solos rendered by this artist,
with great artistic skill in execution
and softness of tone. It is enough to
say that ho put his whole soul into his
work and made the music from the vio
lin responsive to every changing
thought and mood. Many claim that he
is the equal of Elman and Kreisler; his
mastery of the violin is certainly com
plete ar.d in his personality there is a
fire and dash which always win his
audience.
Ope of the best of his renditions Mon
day evening was “The Mocking Bird,”
which was done with wonderful skill.
Among the other selections he so
charmingly rendered were: “Italian
Folk Seng” (arranged), Minuet in 0.
(Beethoven). Finale to ""William Tell
Overture” (Rossini). ""Over There.” As
the finale of the evening's program he
played “Stars and Stripes Forever”
(Sousa).
Between the musical numbers of the
evening Mias Roeelth Knapp Breed, the
famous Boston humorist, gave sketches
from real life which proved most en
joyable. In her readings ahe showed
her gift* of magnetism, wholeeomeneos
and versatility, and ahe kept her V*""
mmw (n the beat of humor- She .depict
ed New Tor* wo— m- her young
son going town street to have luncheon
with her husband; the Chicago factory
glri at the moving pictures, and Aunt
Eliza and her first automobile ride. It j
was indeed an ever-changing scene and.
the characters were presented Just es j
one would expect to see them in real J
life. And each of her readings was
accorded warm applause.
An especially charming number of the
musical program was the selection ""Ave
Maria’’ (Bach-Gounod) rendered by
Mme. Corella, with violin obligato by[
Mr. Adams. The work of the two at- i
companists of the evening, Adelaide I
Keezer and Xan Synott. was greatly ap
preciated by all.
In short, the entire concert more than i
came up to all expectations and the En-;
tertainment Course for this season was |
opened in a most auspicious manner. i

NO EARLY ENACTMENT
OF RADICAL MEASURES
BY BERLIN GOVT.
Merlin. Sunday, Dec. S.—(By The
Associated Press).—The committee
appointed )>y the present government
to work out u plan lor economic so
cialization has held its session but
beyond organizing it lias adopted no
specific program of procedure. The
Herlin Hourse and banking and in
dustrial circles so far as the corre
spondent lias been able to ascertain
do not expect the immediate enact
ment of radical measures. The im
pression prevails that tiic Ebert
Haase government is convinced that
the present, political and economic
situation is inauspicious. This seems
to have been confirmed by recent ut
terances of the leaders of both wings
of the social democracy. Eduard
Hernstein, who represents the revo
lutionary government in the national
ministry of finance m\d who. with
(“ail Kaut/.y, under his secretary of
foreign affairs in the Soldiers’ and
Workmen’s government, shares the
intellectual leadership of the Indepen
dent. Socialists, in a speeeli last night
said the most urgent problem at pres
ent was maintenance of the nation’s
economic system, l’anl Hirsch, Prus
sian minister of the interior and one
of tile leaders of the majority Social
ists. in tile course of an address de
clared that immediate convocation of
the National Assembly was of urgent
necessity lor the purpose of giving
the new stale organization needed
stability. Emil Von Strauss, one of
the leading directors of the Deutsche
bank, said he v. as of the opinion that
the government would make haste
slowly in carrying out its program for
economic radicalization a'nd that the
final decision would lie rendered by

POPE ADVOCATES !
LEA60E OF NATIONS
I
New York. Dec. 9.—Pope Benedict ;
is an advocate of a league of nations j
so constructed as to prevent the pos- j
sibility of future wars, Monsignor 1
Sigourney Fay declared here tonight i
in an address before the league for ;
political education, outlining the fea- j
tures of a recent conversation he had !
with the pontiff. Monsignor Kay re- !
cently returned from Europe whither ,
he had gone as representative of ;
Cardinal Gibbons on a mission with .
the American Red Cross. The pope.
Mgr. Fay said, favors the creation by
the league of nations of a court of j
international appeal with coercive i
power to enforce its decisions and;
favors disarmament of nations to j
such an extend that none would dare
t<j start a war. Speaking as a do
mestic prelate to the Pope and mem
ber of his official family, but not, as
he expressly stated, for the pontiff,
Mgr. Fay urged that the Pope should
have “a voice in guaranteeing last- j
ing peace.” This could be accom- j
plished. he said, not necessarily
through the Pontiff's attendance as
«. delegate at the peaee conference,
but by his representation in any man
ner that the conference might decide.
The Pope had planned early In the
war, the prelate said, to exert his in
fluence with Austria against the re
turn of Palestine to Turkish domina- j
tion in the event that the outcome of
conflict left the Central Powers in '
autlwrity at the peace conference.
Asked by one of the audience if ho
opposed turning over of Palestine to '
the Jews the clergyman stated that
he did not because “every promise
made by the Allies must be kept."" j
His ^attitude in regard to Palestine, '
lie said, was that moral law should ;
prevail. i

But Few People Realize the Import
ance of Proper Storage of their
Batteries During the Long
Winter Months
Until the proper method, which has been the
result of years of study by engineers, was
adopted many costly experiments with storing
batteries had been made at the owners’ ex
pense.
There are two ways of Winter Storage, wet
and dry. Without obligation on your part we
will be pleased to tell you of the advantages of
each method.
Within city limits we will call for and deliver
your battery, making a reasonable charge
therefor. Express should be prepaid on batter
ies sent to us from out of town.
We have all the improved methods and expert
workmen for handling this line of Automobile
business.

Heme Talent Production Preeented
Monday Evening at Odd Follow*
Hall Before Large Crowd—Snappy
Songe and Hits on City Folk* and
Entertaining Numbers Please A'l
What if the hall was very much over
crowded, if there was trouble with the
lighting system, if the air did get hot
and stuffy and a few other minor difH
; cultjes? What mattered all this if the
music was good, the singing and the
j jokes were up to par and beyond, the
; black-faced funny men were light on
: their teet and the whole thing went off
; with a swing that took it out of the
i home Ulent class and put it into the
light and airy class? Such were a few
of the conditions of the minstrel show
which was given Monda .• evening un
der the auspices of the local order of
Odd Fellows in their ball. Much credit
is due Ralph Brann, who had the man
agement of the production in charge
Samuel Titcomb presided in a dignifiel
manner as interlocutor and proved a
most efficient ont. The end men, old
timers among audiences oi the Capital
City, were there in full force and their
side actions were humorous as weil as
diverting.
The first part of the show was an oid
Mme miniature Lew Dockster produc
tion. The overture disclosed the men
seated on the stage all dressed up and
acting as if they had some place to go.
The first solo on the program was ""Ev
erything Is Peaches Down In Georgia,""
sung by Francis Hill. The other musi
.cal numbers were: “You'll Be Proud of
Your Old Black Joe,” Manley Haskell;
""Till We Meet,” Mr. Gilman; ""Out, Oui,
Marie.” Harold Fisher; ""The Horn,”
Eari Hayes; ""I Wish I Was in the Land
'of Cotton Now.” Ralph Brann; ‘When
the Great Red Dawn Is Shining,” David
Campbell; ""You Can Have It, I Don't
‘Want It.” William Bunker; ""At the
Shlm-ml-Sha-Wabbler s Bali,” Ellis
Walker.
The second part of the show consisted
of a character song by Miss Dorothy
Gray; a violin solo by Norman Pierce,
and a Russian dance oy Miss Gray. Fol
lowing ihe show dancing was enjoyed
until a late hour. The musical director
was Aldo Pellegrini of Hallowell and
the success othe musical numbers was
largely due to Mr. Pellegrini's ability.
The crowd was so large that the hall
was crowded to overflowing and it is
understood many were turned away.
The production might have been even
more of a success in a larger hall.

St. John. X. B„ Dec. 16.—All of the
officers and crew cf the Canadian
Pacific steamer Corinthian wrecked
.near Brier Island last Saturday ar
rived here today with the exception
of Capt. David Tannock. The cap
tain remained on board the vessel but
is expected to come here tomorrow,
in his absence no o*ie who was on
the steamer when she went aground

the circumstances. One of the ves
sels which brought the crew said that
at high tides this morning the decks
of the Corinthian were awash, with
only the bradge masts and funnels
out of water. Captain John Walsh

Dempsey Knocks Out
Mom's In One Minute
I Xew Orleans, I.la., Dee. 1C.—Jack
I Dempsey of I""tali, claimant of the
' heavyweight championship, knocked
, out Carl Morris of Oklahoma, in the
i first round of their scheduled 20
l round bout here tonight, alter one
| minute of fighting.
The knockout blow wan a short left
i hook to the stomach delivered during
I period of hard infighting. Many of the
I 7000 spectators believed for a time that
Morris had slipped and fallen, as the
! blow was visible only to those near the
j ringside. The bout started with a brisk
j exchange of short jabs. After breaking
from the first clinch Dempsey rushed
1 Morris near the ropes and during the
I infighting delivered the final blow. Mor
■ ris did not regain consciousness for four
1 minutes. Dempsey weighed in at IS""
' pounds and Morris at 220. They receiv
i ed HOW and S12>0 respectively. The Utah
! Boxer was a favorite in the betting, as
: high as .7 to 1 being offered that he
; would knock out Morris, and 6 to 2 that
the Oklahoman would not last three
rounds. The bout was held in an open
j air arena.
During the few weeks that the short
i term county prisoners have been em
ployed in road building on the Ossi
pee trail, they have earned for them
selves nearly $1000 reports the Sun
day Press. Each man so employed
was allowed 00 cents per day. and
; the county $1.50 per day. The men
; were taken to work and returned each
; night to the jail by one of the county
machines, and the experiment has
j proven to be a success in every way.
i There is over one mile of good road
| to show for their work, and this might
; not have been so easily built, without
j their help on account of the scarcity
j of labor. The coupty just about
i broke even on the proposition but the
i men are ahead considerably, and have
| enjoyed the outing and the change
; from confinement.
j Park Commissioner Samuel M. Hall
' will have charge of the “Victory
s oaks"" to be planied in Peppcrell Park,
i Saco, as a memorial to the Saco
;young men who died for their coun
j try in the war. The planting will
! take place next year and appropriate
' exercises will be held. Chairman
Hall favors white oaks as a memorial
tree, and they wilt be set. out near the
| old burying ground in the park where
• Revolutionary and Civil War heroes
■ sleep. A granite marker, fittingly in
j scribed and containing the names of
| the dead soldiers, will be placed in
the center of the group of trees.

Modern Convenience
“/ Want a Stenographer,
pronto’
When Mr. Busy executive needs a new stenographer he
doesn't wait for someone to “show up,” he straightway
calls the Journal office and asks for an ad under “Help
W7anled” and in three or four short lines he delivers a
message to hundreds of workers who may be • seeking
employment.
Every possible applicant gets the message just as surely
as if “Central” had made all the connections.
Likewise, Mr. Business man knows that through the lit
tle classified ads business property and factory sites are
easily found, that offices, store rooms, and business
buildings are quickly cccupied.
lie knows, too, that partnors are obtained, that he can sell
his last year’s car or get a trade for himself if he is in the
market. In short, he realizes that the Journal’s classified
page is the exchange bureau for unlimited business
wants;—a development of the American idea of hustle,
the cheapest and quickest little business getters evar u*
vented.

“I want a Home”
Give her a home that she can call HER OWN and she is
bound to be happy. Finding a buyer for real estate is an
everyday task for Classified Advertising. Prospec five
buyers turn to “Real Estate For Sale” columns as nat
urally as they turn to the Telephone directory for a num
ber. Real Estate is, there, daily bought, sold and traded
whether it be country home, summer cottage, farm or
city property.
The Journal's classified page is
♦he ready index to everything
doing in the real estate market.
If you want to sell, let the
classified ads bring you cash
in hand; if you want to buy
the simplest thing in the world
is to sec who wants to seLL
Want Ads keep
Mother Smiling
Mother is manager of the home. She has learned
by inexpensive experience just how to find a com
petent maid, how to get the laundering, scrubbing
or dishwashing done quickest, how to turn some
discarded but still useful piece of furniture into
cash, where to locate some valuable old antique,
where to get an occupant for furnished rooms and
thereby increase the family revenue. With all her
household tasks mother has time for other things
and always wears the cheerful smile. Mother
knows Father’s way and lets the classified ad < help
her in her tasks.
“/ Want a Position ’ ’
You don’t know this young woman, neither do we,
but she has just been graduated from the
business college, she has stenography, typewriting
and bookkeeping training. She is ready for work.
If she doesn’t find a place straight away she tells
about her qualifications in the “Positions Wanted”
department. She doesn’t have to wait long for the
right made-to-ordcr job. Business training has
taught her to use the same method if she loses her
pocket book or wishes to find a desirable room.
Capable workers, offering, their services to busi
ness men through the Journal’s columns rarely fail
to find the right opportunity.
I
;
In fact, not many business men would care to em
ploy a man or woman in a position calling for “busi
ness sense” if such applicant had not shown good
evidence of it by having advertised effectively.
Eventually you will find what you are
looking for in the Classified Column?
You may overlook the classified ads for a month without missing a really valuable op
portunity. And yet on any day of that month there may be printed THE ONE AD
VERTISEMENT which'you could not afford to miss under any circumstances.

dear and unmistakable message for YOU.
And that message may be more important to you than any that has ever come to you
by letter, by telephone, telegraph or messenger.
It may be a call to higher business opportunities. It may be a chance to buy or to rent
property such as you alone can fully appreciate. It may be a business opening that
would lead you to the realization of your plans and purposes in life.

SEN. LODGE
(Continued from Page One)
needed for police duty m connection
with the league ot nations, the senator
. said he would not stop to ask who
would order that navy about the sea.
Jle said he would be glad if tile Sen
ate ebates on peace were supplemented
bv some definite resolutions expressing
views on important points, lie contin
ued:
“Whether the Senate will take sue::
action—although I know that w«- have
very definite opinions—I cannot t* J. be
cause there seems to be a !ceding ..mom,
some senate's that it is an act of in
tolerable audacity for the Senate even
to suggest *o the executive that t has
opinions which ought 1 y «■« considered
rvrsonaily. i ao n""i snare uiai view.
""l'eace being our object, the first step
toward peace is to make a peace with
Die country with which we h: ve been
and are at war—that is, with Germany.
If the peace with German.' is to lie dur
able, terms must b^ exacted v.-luch vdl
make it, so far as human foresigh; goes,
impossible for Germany to break out
again upon the world with a war of
conquest. This cannot be drme by
treaty engagements and signatuies to
documents.
""At tins juncture of affairs Germany
would sign anything, ami her pledge
would be as worthless as the guarantees
she gave to Belgium. It is well also to
remember that Germany did not change
its nature over night, wlv 11 the Kaiser
ran away to Holland. The deep-rooted
ambitions, the evil principles carefully
instilled for half a century. the barbar
ous methods and doctrines, all remain
unaltered. 1 do not need to rehearse
what those physical guarantees should
be, for 1 have stated my views upon
them more than once to the Senate, and
1 think there is • enera' agrr ment upon
them, not only m the Senate but among
the American people.
""They include,the res*oration of Bel
gium. the return of Alsace-Lorraine to
France, of the Italian irredenta to Italy,
the < stablishment of a .Tugo-.Stav state
and of an independent state formed by
tiie U'zecho-Slovaks.
""We include also the security of
Greece, the settlement of Albania and
Montenegro, the restoration of Ruma
nia, the consolidation of all the Ruma
nian people under one government, us
well as the neutralization of the straits,
the putting o Constantinople under in
ternational protection wi'h Greece per
haps as tlie mandator • of the powers to
administer the affairs of tile city, the
independence of Armenia, the return of
those portions of Asia Minor where
Greeks are predominant to Greece, the
protection of hra and i’nlestine from
the Turks, a large, powf ul and inde
pendent Polish state, the independence
of Russia's Baltic provinces, the return
of Danish Schleswig to the Danes and
the neutralization of the Kiel canal.
‘ Those physical gun ranters which
1 have thro far suggested all have an
object, and that is so to hem Germany
in that she cannot attempt conquest
in Russia or in the east, and that the
Slavic populations, which she has
mercilessly used in her wars, can
never be so used by her again.
""In addition to these guatantees
there must be heavy indemnities paid
by Germany for the ruin she has
wrought in Belgium and northern
France and m Italy and for her de
struction of vessels, both neutral and
belligerent, through the use of sub
marines. In those indemnities the
United States must have its proper
and proportionate sharp, not only di
rect indemnify for its ships destroyed
by submarines and its people mur
dered on the Lusitania and other ves
sels, but a suitable restitution, in
part, at least, of the vast expenses
forced upon us by Germany.
""It will be for the peace conference
to determine what disposition should
be made of the German colonies, but
one thing is essentia! .and that Is that
they should not be returned to the ;
tyiannical misgovemment of Ger
many. and that she should be de
prived of these means of, extending
her commerce and building tip mili
tary outposts In all parts of the world.
""It in the duty ef the All'r a.-.d the
United fttutPS to meet and determine :
what term* they will Impose upon 1
j Germany and then, and not until
| then, call in the representatives of
Germany and impoke ff.e term* upon
them.”
Of the league of nations proposal
| Senator Ividge said no definite plan
, has >et been put forth that would not
■ cause indefinite controversy.
“The attempt to form now a league
I of nations—and I mean an effective
j league, with power to enforce its de
; crees,” he said, “can tend only to em
barrass the peace that we ought to
; make at once with Germany. If it
; were successful and * * * were to
! cotne before the Senate, it might en
, danger the peace treaty and force
amendments. * * *
' Are we prepared to allow any as
sociation of nations by a majority
vote to order the troops and ships of
the United States to go to war? Un
less we are prepared to do so we are
: not prepared to join a league of na
tions which is going to enforce
; peace.”
In urging postponement of the
! question of freedom of the seas Sen
| ator Ix>dge saict it was another un
defined question, and added:
""if it means abandonment of the
tight of blockade, 1 think the United
Slates will hesitate before it abandons
a weaupn absolutely necessary for
its own safety. 1 cannot imagine that
Kng'.and would for a moment think
| of abandoning the belligerent right
of blockade.”
Discussing secret diplomacy, the
Senator said this point of President
i Wilson's need not be incorporated in
•.he peace treaty because secret treats
ie~ never had existed, and could not
1 exist in this country. He added:
' Scc-rct diplomacy is a loose term.
I think that the question is of no vital
; importance at this moment, and
I whatever our views may be about the
’n*-thods of diplomacy, we car, make
> peace with Germany without undor
■ taking b settle what shall constitute
■ diplomacy in the future and
: what shah not.”
Urging postponement of action on the
matter of economic barrisrs, lie said it
■ p.-ned a wide field of discussion and its
settlement was not in the least essential
to ending the war by a peace wiih Ger
mane.
We can make that peace,” he con
tinued, - without determining at this
moment what we shall do with our tar

tHat there would he no quarter shown

Meeting of the Legislature.
There was little of the excitement at
tending the gathering of the Maine leg
islature last week which is sometime* in
evidence. This was because of lack of
what may be called political features.
Both house· being strongly Republican,
tb»re was no question as to what nomi
nees would prevail, and the contesta
were wholly within the Republican con
tingent in each house.
Of the contests, that which created the
most interest and was the most doubtful
op to tbe time of the ballot, was for the
presidency of tbe Senate. Several mem
bers were early announced as candidates,
but before it came to the caucus tbe list j
had practically simmered down to two.
Tbe ballot resulted in 14 votes for Leon
P. Higgins of Brewer, Senator from
Penobscot County, and 13 for John P.
Deering of Saco, Seoatjr from York
County.
Percy P. Crane of Whiting was chosen
Secretary of the Senate, and Harry P.
Β awes of Vassalboro Assistant Secretary
There bad also been a lively campaign
for Speaker of tbe Bouse, tbe candidates
being Prank G. Parriogton of Angusta,
Charles P. Barnes of Houlton, and Erneet
P. Clason of Lisbon Before tbe time
for the caucus arrived, this contest bad
so clesred that when it came to tbe nom
ination, Mr. Parrington was named by
acclamation, Mr. Barnes presenting his
name and Mr. Clason joining in second
ing tbe nomination.
Clyde R. Chapman of Pairfleld was
nominated Clerk of the House, and
Bertrand Ε. Smith of Augusta Assistant
Clerk
There were one or two contests for
minor officials of the House, in one of
which Benjamin A. Swasey of Augusta,
a former Oxford County man, secured
the nomination for Second Folder over
the other candidate.
All the foregoing relates to tbe doings
of the Republican caucuses, whiob met
Tuesday eveoing, tbe nominees being
duly eleoted wben the legislature con
ven*>d on Wednesday. The Democratic
matr.bers of tbe House nominated Sher
man L. Berry of Waterville for Speaker
of tbe House, and made complimentary
nominations for tbe other positions.
These four state officials who bave
se.'ved for tbe past two years were re
elec'ed without content:
Secretary of Slate—frank W Ball. Dover.
State Treasurer—Jooepb W. Simpson, York.
Attorney General—Guy H. Sturgte, Portland.
CommlMloner of Λ ^culture—John A. Rob
erts, Norway.
Tbe Executive Council was elected as
follows:
Edward Γ. Uowell, Berwick.
George W. Norton. Portland.
W aiter Β. Plummer, Lisbon.
Willie Ε Swift. August*.
RimerS. Blrl, Rockland
Norman II. Fay. Dexter.
Clarence A. Powers, Fort Fairfield.
Od Wednesday the two bouses of the
législature met and organized, the oath
being administered by Governor Carl E.
Milliken, and a considerable amount of
routine business such as always moat be
done at the opt oing of the session was
disponed of.
Thursday m joint convention of the
two bouses of the legislature Carl E.
Milliken was io augura'ed for a second
term as Governor of Maine, and delivered
bis add*.ess to the legislature. Tbe
governor's address is an able and busi
nesslike paper dealing w'tb the affairs
of tbd atate, and every citizen will do
well to read it. Tbe Democrat is not
able to give It in full, but for tbe benefit
ot those who do not have It elsewhere
available, tbe following brief summary
of it aa made by one of the newspapers
it given:
Urge· that in all deliberations ot com
ing session the legislature aid in every
feasible and proper way the great process
of readjustment wbich is going on in the
uatioo.
Especially recommends oo operation
witb ""any reasonable plane tbe U. S.
Government may work out for facilitat
ing the return of soldiers to industry or
eucouragitig their establishment upon
farms.""
Emphasizes tbe importance df food
production and problems of rural life
and urges need of co-operation between
all organizations 4bd agencies wbich oon
cern them.
Recommends changes in Workmen's
Compensation Law in order to bring it
up to the ideal standards.
Renews request of two years ago for
passage of law providing for tbe separate
classification of intangible personal prop
erty for purposes of taxation.
Advises consideration of legislation
permitting and encouraging tbe combi
nation of towns into large unita for the
care of paupers at centra) almshouse·.
Enactment of a law authorizing towns
to combine into districts for the purpose
of employing public health officers and
providing that part of tbe salary snob
officers shall be paid by the state.
Extension of agricultural education to
farming communities. · · · The
time haa oome to insist that all instruc
tion in elementary subjects be given in
other than in tbe English language. * *
Further expansion of our system of
evening and part-time schools for adnlts
of foreign birth.
Urges most carefnl and rigid eoonomj
in appropriation. · · · The budget
should be continued. · · · Liberal
allowance advocated for State pensions.
* * * Salaries of State officials and
employes sbonld be readjusted.
Suggests that Maine and New Hamp
shire might agree upon tbe building of
a new bridge be'ween Portsmouth and
Kiitery in plaoe of present insecure and
inadequate toll bridge. Points out that
not only la such a bridge needed but
that it would stand as a joint memorial
to tbe soldier and sailor dead because of
tbe fsct that most of tbe overseas
casualties from both states were In tbe
matchless 103d Infantry, composed of
Maine and New Hampshire men.
Shortly aft^r tbe inauguration oere
monies, the two houses adjourned until
4:30 o'elook Tuesday afternoon, when
the committee· will be announced.

Lately we came across several copiei
of the Democrat insued in the political
campaign of 1868 (âf:y years ago.) Tht
Democrat was then edited and published
by F. Κ Shaw. It was quite interesting
to look over there old papers and recal
the old Κ cal correspondents nearly all ol
whom bave pa»sed away. Several locali
that we wrote SO years ago appeared
The most frequent ones were signed
""Hartford"" from the pen of Wm. Bick
□ ell. Dr. W. B. Lapham appeared at
""Index."" These old papers look to u>
like old familiar friends and recall eventi
nearly forgotten. The local paper pos
sesses a charm that the big daily oity
paper cannot awaken. The local count]
paper is worth saving. Some of the big
city papers we use to kindle the fires,
but never the old revered Democrat.
Long may it prosper.

Taking Salt Out of Salt Lake.
Perhaps no salt ponds anywhere in the
world possess so many natural ad·
vantage· as the Great Salt Lake, say·
Stanley W. Todd in the December
Popular Meebanica Magazine. Lying as
it does in one of the great valley· of the
Rockies, on the eastern edge of the
great basin, the lake extendi north and
sonth for 75 mile·, while It· width varie·
from 30 to 50 miles. It baa an average
depth of 20 ft and Is 4,218 ft. above the
aea level. There i· little rainfall through
out the year, and the ever-present ran,
together with the flat shore·, oon
tribnte to the ideal oondltloni of the
summer operation. The lake ha· no
outlet and the water is as nearly saturat
ed with salt as It oan be wlthont crystal
lizing. Great stride· have been made In
recent years In the methods of making
high-grade salt both by the gralner ana
vacuum-pan processes. Solar évapora·
tlon and gralner metboda are used at
Salt Lake, the mill being looated at a
place sailed Saltair. During the season
when the harveatlng I· under way, the
water la pumped from the lake at the
rate of from 10,000 to 12.000 bbl. a day,
the pumping being carried on from 10

at Pemaquid."" Sburt was the agent for
Abraham Jennesea or Jennings, pro
prietor of tbe Plymouth oounoil's grant
to lands around the eastern estuary of
the Kennebec river, Pemaquid being tbe
principal station. Tbe grant included
Monbegan Island and this was first set
tled. Short is best known to fame by
reason of being tbe first man in this
country to make a deed whereby tbe
Indian sagamore Somerset sold to one
John Brown a tract of land. The deed
was evidently drawn by Sburt and be
acknowledged it.
Make a Fresh 8tart Now.
Never wait until tomorrow to make
a fresh start or to turn over a new
leaf. The time to begin again Is when
you feel dissatisfied with things as
they are. Every postponement makes
it easier to wait a little longer, and
the reasons for putting off your fresh
start one day are Just as good for the
next day's postponement When you
fall In the mud you do not think it
necessary to He prostrate for a certain
number of minutes or hours. Instead
you scramble to your feet and start
over. The time to make a fresh be
ginning is the moment you fall.
Fault-Finding.
Why should we denounce fault-find
ing because it is not constructive? All
of us are continuously finding fault,
more or less, and on our success in
finding the fault and destroying it de
pends mostly our successful develop
ment So In the end it appears that
fault-finding is essentially one of our
most constructive activities. One of
our worst faults is the hypocritical
practice of finding fault with fault
finding.—F. H. Young In Providence
Journal.

ONE OF WAR'S GREA? DEEDS
Crossing of 8t Quentin Canal by Brit
ish Troops Conceded to Bo
Remarkable Exploit
Probably one of the most remark·
able exploita of the war was the cross
ing of the St Quentin canal by a
brigade of South Staiford and North
Stafford (British) troops In the course
of the advance on OambraL The
canal la a landmark In the country
for miles around because of Its dimen
sions, and Just where the crossing was
effected the waterway runs for some
distance between very steep and high
banks covered in some parts by dense
low brushwood. That the crossing
was made by such a large number of
men and so expeditiously Is a remark
able tribute to the determination of
the men nnd to the forethought of their
commanders. It Is related that their
commanding officer had sent down to
a channel port and had had sent up to
the line for the occasion all the life
belts of one of the well-known cross
channel steamers. It was this measure
of precaution which was the means
of enabling many men to cross before
foot-bridges could be constructed and
which was the main contributing fac
tor In the success of the operation.
Tact Saved the Situation.
The newly created English high com
missioner In Siberia, Sir Charles Eliot,
has served in official capacities In
Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Mo
rocco and the United States. His task
in Siberia Is a delicate one, but tact
is Sir Charles' strong point
When vice chancellor of Sheffield
university Sir Charles created amuse
ment by a remark he made at a uni
versity dinner. ""Of the changea of th«
past year,"" he said, ""the one which
strikes mc most and pleases me most
is that every day us I take my walk
In the university corridors I see young
ladles walking about In §owns."" And
there lie stopped, but the roar of laugh
ter caused him to continue: ""In aca
demic gowns, which look most pic
turesque.""
Memory Course.
J. Leonard Iteplogle, the govern
ment's official steel buyer, was un er
raud boy at fourteen and a millionaire
at thirty-five.
""Work Is the aecret of success,"" said
Mr. Replogle in α Y. M. C. A. undress.
""I don't take much stock in fads and
efficiency courses and so ou as succeM
helps.
""A clerk said to me the other duy:
""Ί expect to make a success of mj
life at last. I'm taking oue of these
memory courses. It's a magnificent
thing.'
"" 'What's the name of the courseΐ
suld L
"" 'Darned If I can remember the
name,' suld the clerk In ε vexed
voice.' ""
Non-Combatant Tanks.
Not all uriny tanks are destructive
of human life. Thjse of the sanltarj
corps are dangerous only to germs.
The necessity of eradicating these
from the driuking water of the sol·
dier» has been met by ι lie organizatloi
of purification units υι mobile tvutei
trains. These consist of a number ol
heavy motor trucks, each of which W
α complete filtration plant in Itself, In
eluding a laboratory for testing. Thej
are equipped to both filter and chetnl·
cally purify the water, which muy bt
pumped up from a river bed or anj
convenient source. Attached to eact
train are β number of simple tan!
trucks used for storage or trauspor
tation of the purified water.
In Memory of French Heroes
It is believed that with the close ol
the war the entire line of trenches ir
France, extending from Alsace to the
Belgian border, may he converted Intc
a sort of national sacred forest as t
permaneut tribute to the memory o1
the Freuch ""Poilus,"" who died then
defending their native soil. A propos!
tlon to this effect has been propsrec
by the general council of the depart
ment of the Meuse and will be sub
mltted to not only France, but the en·
tire worjd.

buy what you need for present use. Our

than the market conditions at the time
you purchase warrant.
We are particularly anxious that you understand the
service and treatment we accord our customers. Simply
selling a suit or other garment and letting our responsi

A Foremost Citizen
of the World
(Continued from P«B® 6)
i Little Missouri River, in North Dako
ta. and divided his time between out
; door sports, particularly hunting, and
literary work. Here he laid the foun
dation for his series of books, ""The
' Winning of the West,"" which was
published from 1889 to 1898. and of
otfier volumes of kindred character.
Returning to New York he became
; the Republican candidate for Mayor,
in 188$. He was defeated. President
Harrison in 3583 appointed him a
member of the United States Civil
Service Commission and President
Cleveland continued him in this of
fice. which he resigned in 1SS5 to be
come New York City's police commis
sioner.
""A ihir.g that attracted me to this
■ office,'' Roosevelt said at the time he
accepted this appointment, ""was that
i it was to be done in the hurly-burly,
' for I don't like cloister life."" Hones
t ty was the watchword of this admin
: istration, and the two years of his oc
cupancy became mem^able through
the reforms he inauguOTted. attract
ing the nation's attention while hold
ing a position which was obscure in
comparison with the events i > < ""fr
Illicit liquor traffic, gambling. vi< e
general—of these evils he purged the
city in the face of corrupt political
opposition, and the reputation he es
tablished as a reformer won him the
personal selection by President Mc
Kinley as Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, in 1897. A year later the Span
ish American War broke out.
Th« Roosevelt Rough Rider*
The Roosevelt temperament did not
allow the man to retain a deputy cab
inet position with war offering some
thing more exciting. Leonard Wood,
now a major-general, was then Pres
ident M Kinlcy's physician and one
of Roosevelt's staunchest friends.
The famous Rough Riders were or
ganize! by Wood and Roosevelt—a
band <f fighting men the mention
whose name today suggests imme
diately the word ""Roosevelt."" They
. amc out of the west—plainsmen, mi
ners, rough and ready fighters who
were natural marksmt n, and Wood
be. a me 1 lit 11 Colonel and 'Todd'.."" as
lie iiad become familiarly called by
the public, their Lieutenant-Colonel.
In company with the regulars of the
army they took transports to Cuba,
landed at Santiago and were soon en
gaged in the thick of battle. Among
the promotions which this hardy reg
iment's gallantry brought about were
those of Wood to Brigadier-General
ar.d Roosevelt to Colonel—and this
title Theodore Roosevelt cherished
until the end. Some of the Rough
Riders formed the military escort
when he was elected President a few
years later.
When Cuba had been liberated,
Roosevelt returned to New York. A
gubernatorial campaign was in
swing, with the Republican Party in
need of a capable candidate. Roose
velt was nominated. Van Wyck, his
J lemocratic opponent, was defeated!
The reforms Roosevelt had favored as
Assemblymen he cow had the oppor
tunity to consummate, together with
others of more importance, and it was
during this administration that he is
said first have earned the hostility of
corporations. When the Republican
national convention was held in Phil
adelphia in 1900 his party in New
York State demanded and attained
iiis nomination for Vice President on
the t. koi with William McKinley. In
November of that year this ticket
was elected.
Followed McKinley Pjliciee.
The policies of McKinley. Roosevelt
i nd< avored to carry out after he suc
fc'iled the former upon the Presi
d*-ut's tragic death at the hards of an
* « issin. Roosevelt retained his pred
ecessor's cabinet as his own and he
hept in office the ambassadors and
ministers whom McKinley had ap
pointed. As much as two years be
fore the Presidential campaign of l&M
Republican organizations in various
states began endorsing him as their
m xt candidate.
it was thus that the man of des
tiny"" idea be. arm associated with ids
life. Ostensibly. Roosevelt. leaving
the governorship •>! New York to be
come Vice President, was moving lor
vard Horn state politics into na
tional politcs, so ids political oppo
n nts professed publicly to believe;
but it was their secret desire to
""shelve"" the man and eliminate him
from prominence in their own com
munity. it was said, that prompted
these political fois to obtain for him
the Vice Presidential nomination,
which he personally did not dtgire.
At the height of his public and
political career, during the four years
of the term for which he had been
elected. Uoosevelt accomplished
achievements which historians will
rank high in the international and
industrial progress of the country.
They included his influential negotia
tions which, conducted at Ports
mouth, X. H.. effected peace between
Russia and Japan; maintenance of
the Monroe Doctrine at a period when
European Powers were interested in
the affairs of Venezuela; the recog
nition of Panama as a Republic and
liis treaty with Panama hy which the
inter-oceanic canal through . that
country was put under way: and the
settlement, through his moral influ
ence in the face of a situation in
which there was no adequate Federal
legislation, of the Pennsylvania coal
mine strike. For his part 4n termi
nating the Russo-Japanese conflict he
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 190C. Folr years later, once more
a private citizen, he was special am
bassador from the United States at
the funeral of King Edward VII of
England.
The Break with Taft.
A rift in the friendship between
Roosevelt and his successor as Presi
dent, William Howard Taft, led to the
former's announcement of his opposi
tion to Mr. Taft's renomination. The
ex-President’s influence had been
large in placing Mr. Taft in the White
House. Now his influence was equal
ly Btrong in preventing Mr. Taft
from remaining there. Men who had
clashed with the Taft policies quickly
rallied to Roosevelt's support. Roose
velt assembled what he termed as
constructive ideas as opposed to the
conservative ones of the so-called Re
publican ""Old Guard.” characterized
them with the description ""Progres
sive"" and organized the Progressive,
Party bv withdiawlng with his fol
lowers from the Chi. ago convention
of 1912. He l.ecam- the new party's
candidate for President. Thta split in
the Republican ranks remlted In
Woodrow Wilson's election.
Shot by « Crank.
One of the most dramatic Incidents ,
in Roosevelt's life occurred during
this campaign. As he was leaving a
hotel, in Milwaukee, to go to a meet
ing hall to make a political eddreas. a
man standing among the spectators
in the street tired a shot which struck
the Colonel and smashed a rib. j
Roosevelt insisted he was not serious
ly hurt and his automobile conveyed
him to the hall. There he spoke to an
audience which had knowledge of :
what had happened—sobbing women
and grave-faced men shaken with
emotion by his appearance under such j
circumstances. Examination of the j
wound showed it was serious and the
candidate was hurried by special
train to Chicago for treatment.
Though he speedily recovered the
bullet was never removed. The as
sassin was sent to 8n asylum for the
insane.
Roosevelt after leaving the White
House devoted his life largely to lit- j
®rary work, hunting and exploration.
He became contributing editor to The
Outlook in 190?. continuing this for j
five years, and later held editorial |
position with The Metropolitan and (
the Kansas City Star. From lSSJ to j
1917 he published about fifty volumes :
o' works covering the wide range of !
eaval history, hunting, biography, the \
ough Riders. Americanism, Xation
.ism. conservation of womanhood i
and childhood, animals, explorations.'
the world war and America's par- I
tiojpation in it. and his autobiography.
!iis hunts for big game and his z*'st'
for exploration took him into the
American West, the heart of Africa
and the wilderness of Brazil.
His Triumphs in Europ*.
Upon his return from his African
journey—a return during which he
made triumphant entries into Euro
pean capitals and was received by
nations’ rulers, including the Em
porer of Germany—he arrived in New
York to experience what was gener
ally conceded to !>e the greatest ova
tion an American private citizen was
< ver accorded by the people of his
country. This was in 191 ». At the
head of an exploring party in South
America in 1914 he discovered and
followed for 60'J miles a Maderia
River tributary which the Brazilian
Government subsequently rained, in
his honor Reo Theodoro. This was
the famous ""River of Doubt”—so
c-albd because in many quarters con
sidered authoritative it was ques
tioned whether Roosevelt was the
first man to explore the stream. Dur
ing tins journey the President con
tracted a jungle fever which was held
indirectly responsible for the abscess
es which developed malignantly and
required several operations at Roose
velt hospital in New York City, in
191S.
Theodore Roosevelt, besides being a
prolific writer, lecturer end made
public speeches extensively, not only
in his own country but m England,
Spam, South America and other parts
of the world. The facility with
which he made political enemies and
followers made him a marked man for
both the bitter and friendly attention
of cartoonists and paragraphers.
R'uaint and picturesque phrases were
coined liberally by him and by others
concerning him. ""Speak s""ftlv and
use the big stick.” ""weasel words.""
• pussyfoot."" 'mollycoddle"" and ""my
hat is in the ring.” were some of the
Rooseveltian expressions which at
tained wide publicity.
ouAiny vqsi an tyc.
The strenuous physical activities in
which Roosevelt engag'd rt the White
House included boxing. ,'t was not
until about eight years after he left
the White House that it was dis
closed that during one of these bouts,
which he welcomed as a means of
keeping him in fighting trim, a blow,
landed bv a sparring opponent in
jured one of the Colonel's eyes Rater
blindness of this eye developed.
In the later years of his life two
court suits, in which hr: figured in
one- as plaintiff and in the < ther as ,
defendent, winning them both, kept
Roosevelt before the public i ye. Har
ing the Presidential campaign of
13111 a Michigan editor charged him
with intoxication. 1 loosev it insti
tuted a suit for libel and marshalled
a notable host of witnesses to testify
regarding his private life and habits.
Their testimony was so overwhelming
that the charge was withdrawn in
ope n court and the jury brought in a
nominal verdict of six cents in favor
of the ex-President. William Harnett,
Jr., of Albany, X. Y„ accused Roose
velt in 1311 of uttering libel in a
statement asserting that the ‘rotten
ness” of the New York State govern
ment was due directly to the domi
nance of Tammany Hall in politics,
aided by Mr. Haines and his follow
ers. At Syracuse, N. V.. in 1315 the
jury’s verdict acquitted Roosevelt.
Saw America's Danger.
When the Kuropean war began,
Roosevelt vigorously advocated a pol
ity of national preparedness, urging
universal military training for the
nation's youth. Jn speeches through
out the country and in his magazine
and newspaper writings he criticized]
in this respect, the policies ti Wood
row Wilson during .Mr. Wilson's first
term as President.
Mr. Roosevelt. It has been said, was
keenly disappointed when he did not
receive the Republican nomination
for President in ISlti. At the same
time, however, he refused to follow
the advice of some of his staunchest
followers that he again head the Pro
gressive Party ticket. Instead he pre
vailed upon the Progressive Party to
make Charles Evans Hughes, the Re
publican candidate, its own choice.
He campaigned for Mr. Hughes. With :
the re-election of Mr. Wilson, and '
America's entry into the world war
soon after, Roosevelt immediately
supported the President and bitterly
ass-ailed the pro-Germans, pacifists
and other type of men who attempted
to delay speeding up the war.
Was Kept Out of War.
With the United States a bellig
erent, Roosevelt endeavored to obtain
the consent of the War Department 11
establish an army division whic.i he
was anxious to take to Prance. TJs
division was to have included many of
the Rough Riders who were his asso- j
dates in the campaign in Cuba, and ]
younger men of the same strenuous i
habits. The necessary permission far
INFLUENZA AGAIN IS
A SERIOUS MENACE
Epidemic Comes Back and Victims Number
Thousands
You Can’t Be too Careful If You Have a Cold—
Treat It Promptly with Father John’s Medicine
The public should realize the truth j
concerning the grip epidemic. It is
again raging violently and the num
ber of cases reported shows that its
victims number thousands. We have
lost more people through this disease
than during the struggle with Ger
many.
While we drove it hack for a time,
it has returned with full vigor and in
some places is even worse than dur
ing the fall.
If you become weak or run down,
you are in danger from the germ
which is everywhere present. If you
catch cold your danger is even great
er because colds quickly develop into
grip or pneumonia.
In this time of dangc-jr Father
John’s Medicine should be kept on
hand ir. every home. The pure food
ingredients of this old fashioned
medicine build new strength to fight
off the disease. It is the logical, safe
remedy for colds; its soothing ele
ments hi&l the irritated lining of the
breathing passages; its g-*ntle laxa
tive effect drives out impurities; its
strength-giving elements rebuild
wasted tissue.
Because of the fact that it is
guaranteed absolutely free from alco
hol or any dangerous, narcotic drugs
m any form whatever. Father John's
Medicine may be taken with safety by
every member of the family. Moth
ers especially should watch the
health of their children at this time
because it is notable that the present
grip epidemic is spreading more vio
lently among children than the for
mer epidemic.
Health authorities agree that avoid
ance of crowd*, plenty of fresh air,
proper nourishment and rest, all of
which combined with a proper tonic
to maintain resisting power, are the
commonsense methods of fighting off
the epidemic.
The danger is one which cannot be
overlooked. To guard against it in
every way possible is a duty in which
everyone must help. Get a bottle of
Father John's Medicine today anil
keep it in the house all the time.—

the formation of such a force was not
forthcoming even though Roosevelt ex
pressed wi'lingness to accompany it as
ni subordiate officer.
One of Roosevelt's participations in
Public affairs took him t_> Washington
in January, ISO*, when he conferrei
with I'nited States Senator George ri.
Chamberiain of Oregon an ! either mem
bers of Congress who were critical of
the Administration s methods of prose
cuting the war. RooseveU on this occa
sion announced his support of the pro
posal that a wan cabinet be organized
to take over the conduct of the war.
Denied the privilege of lighting for Ins
flag, Theodore Roosevelt - interest was
centered on his fair.ii' 's participation in
the war. His four .sons and Ins son-ir
law. Ur. Derby, carried out a i redictio.n
made by the former Tn sident bcfo.e
the United States took up arms—that
if war came they would enter service.
Theodore, Jr., became a major and Ar
chibald a captain, both in France;
Quentin entered a French aviation
squadron, and I)r. Derby the medical
service, also both in France. Kc-rmit,
failing to pass a physical examination
which would admit him to the United
States Army, received a commission in
the British Army and was soon in Mes
opotamia.
Pride in His Sons.
Roosevelt took keen pride in the
service button lie wore with its Jive
stars. Talking with newspaper men
some months after his boys hail gone
abroad, he told them privately that
Theodore had written him that he dial
been in action and that a bullet had
struck his trench helmet and glanced
off; Theodore wrote home, his father
said, tho* he regretted he had not been
wounded just for the experience. At
the time of this conversation, public an
nouncement had just been made that
“Archie ‘ had d.een jumped in rank
from second lieutenant to captain.
Roosevelt confided with giee to his
listeners that '‘Archie’’ had led a raid
ing party out into .Vo Man's Land at
t ight, and that the promotion had heen
won by gallantry under fire during this
raid. The Colonel disclosed further that
Kerinit. fighting with the Anglo-Indian
forces, also had been under fire, ns the
leader of “a troop of Whirling Der
vishes,’ “ Indian Cavalry.
The death of Lieut. Quentin Roosevelt
while a sad blow to the Colonel and
Mrs. Roosevelt, was accepted philosoph
ically and with a patriotic pride in their
brave son's fate that has helped thou
sands of other parents the better to
bear their own losses.
“Unconditional surrender,’’ was the
Colonel's demand from first to last. He
had r,o patience with “peace notes’’
from this country or any other to the
enemy.
Died Jar. «. 1919.

cerned Corporal George W. Morrill
of Sanford certainly has a very cred
itable record This sketch will show
how, not satisfied with the decisions
of his superiors, ho defied military
regulations, and succeeded in tak ng
an active part in this conflict. Aft?r
having been discharged from the
old 6th Company of Sanford lie re
enlisted in the Coast Artillery at
Portland, but on taking federal ex
amination in April, 1917. he was dis
charged again on account of hav
ing lost two fingers and a thumb on
his left hand. But this did not dis
courage him and after four weeks of
I>ersistent attempts at re-entering
service and with the use of persuas
ive methods, he succeeded in obtain
ing the necessary papers from M ash
irgton. D. C , to be accepted. He
then joined Co. G. 103rd Infantry, f>Id
Second Maine, 26:h Division, at Au
gusta and crossed to France, when
be remained in the cook shack for
three months. At the end of tint
time, believing he could handle a gun
much better than a frying pan. b.n
zo ned the snipers in February, l.‘l>.
He was made a corporal in April ;iu1
on July Is hr- led his company over
the top. taking bis objective and
holding it. With 12 of bis men, he
went into No Man's I.and to bring
the wounded first aid. but the enemy
turned their machine gun on him
and shot ihe wounded off his back,
throwing him 100 feet away. It was
then that »'orp. Morrill was reported
as se-ii.usly wound'd and was re
moved from one hospital !■> another.
His mother has just receivd a letter
stating that hr had returned to his

Belfast Hello Girl
Still Enjoys Swim
Belfast. Me., Jan. 4.—Miss Helen
Hamm, an attractive “hello"" girl of
Belfast, has broken alt records for
cold weather swimming in this sec
tion of Maine, and it is doubtful if
her record can be duplicated in any
part of tlie State. She has been in
the water nearly every day since last
summer, and plans, if the bay does
not freeze over, to go in all wm'cr.
“If I can go in on Christmas day,
there is no reason why it cannot he
done all winter, if the bay continues
open."" said Miss- Hamm, ns she came
dripping cu;* of the ice odd brine on
Dec. 25th. ""In fact the shock of go
ing into the water is not nearly as
severe at this season as in July or
August, when the water is still very
cold on this coast and the air is so
very warm. At such a time the dif
feren o in the temperature is very
great and i find It much harder to get
into the water. Now with the air so
cold there I searcef? notice the
c hange from it to the water.""
Miss Hamm is a splendid swim
mer and diver and although she rare
ly ever swims fast, she can swim a
long distance easily. She wears a
one-piece suit similar to that worn by
men swimmers. When site comes out
of the water on these cold frosty
days, she is glowing with color and
her blood is circulating so freely that
she reacts splendidly. 8hP feels
much better for the plunge and has
not had a cold all winter. All
through the epidemic of Influenza
in Belfast she continued to tak- her
daily swim and she believes it kept
her well and strong.
Miss Hamm can do many other
things besides swim. In addition to
being one of the most competent toli
operators in the local exchange, she
makes all her own clothing. Mims .:ei
own hats and is as skillful in building
a coat or suit as she is an evening
gown or shirt waist. In the summer
she- makes a vegetable garden end
often can be seen wearing her bath
ing suit while hoeing ""corn and
’laters."" She also finds the suit very
comfortable in doing housework and
often wears it during the house
cleaning season. Miss Hamm is a
graduate of the Belfast Hich school
and is an exceedingly bright and at
tractive girl.
While she has made herself famous
in the locality by her cold weather
swimming, she does not regard it as
anything out of the ordinary and
ean't understand why others who are
so keen about the sport in summer
should lay away their bathing suits
on Labor day. She skates, snow shoes
and is a graceful dancer. She is tall
and slender and a blond.

We Shall Do Our 1
Best in 1919
! {
_
To our customers and the public we wish prosperity and
I happiness daring 1919 and for many years to come.
If we succeed in promoting your comfort; adding to your
convenience, helping in your prosperity—be sure we will be
glad of it.
For ourselves, we hope to win success in our particular
business in exchange for the kind of effort that deserves
success.
Perhaps you never considered that a public utility com
pany that is anxious to increase its business MUST try hard
to please its customers.
THE MORE ENERGETICALLY A COMPANY WORKS
: FOR NEW BUSINESS, THK MORE PAINSTAKING
1 MUST BE THE EFFORT TO RENDER GOOD SERVICE.
It is human to fall short of the goal set by ambition; it
is disheartening to fail occasionally when we want to please
the most. In the long run, however, conscientious effort
wins its own reward and honest recognition.
We can assure you that we shall do our best to maintain
your good opinion in the year we are just beginning.

specialists, took medicines, used
lotions ; but nothing did me good.
Then, I began to use “Fruil-a

cuder and the ltheumatism was
better. Gradually, “Eruil-a-lives""
overcame my Rheumatism; and now,
for five years, I have had no return

It Can't Leak
Because it’s Made
in one Piece
—that’s why we guarantee
satisfaction or you money back
Why is the Kantleek so different from
other hot water bags—why do we say
it can't leak? Because there’s rot a
single seam, patch, joint or splice to
open up and leak. Because the bsg
is molded into one piece—neck, cides,
bottom and all. Because it is made
from the best of rubber, scientifically
treated to give long and sa tisfactory
non-leakmg service. Because yo*; can
feel the quality of this soft, pliable
rubber.
And it’s guaranteed not to leak. If
any Kantlcek Hot Water Bag leaks
within two years from the date of
purchase, bring it back, and get a new
bag absolutely free.
The only hot water bag that comes
to you with such absolute protection
, against leakage. You take no chances
when you buy one. $2.25.

scarce and very expensive. The Nor
walk tubes are made from pure gum
rubber, built up in laminated form,
greatly adding to strength, eliminat

in tubes, and overcoming th£ grain in
the rubber, which makes it appear
rotten even when new, as it will tear

Some people have the idea
—that everything will be cheaper from now on. Some things may
be, but practically everything you wear will be higher next spring
than it has been this season. By next fall prices may be slightly
lower, but probably not any lower than our regular prices of this sea
son. Meanwhile our
Mark-Down
Sale!
Ge?7*igbi 1913. 7h« Rw of Xuppoofeolaw* ,
—gives you an opportunity to tide you over this critical period just
ahead—by getting some of these fine garments of pre-war quality
at substantial reductions from the exceptionally low prices they've
been selling at all this season.
We’re not holding this sale to rid our stock of
any “war fabrics” which will soon be unsalable
at any price, nor to work off any manufac
turer’s mistakes, nor to square ourselves for
over-charging in the past.
Its sole purpose is to reduce stocks to a peace
basis so that we may offer our customers
new goods as soon as they are available in
qualities and at prices equal to our offerings
of this present season.
So don't hesitate to buy anything you expect to need for the rest of
this winter and all of next, for you’ll see no values better than these,
if as good, either here or elsewhere, during that time.

MAINE LAWMAKERS COMPLETE
FOURTH WEEK WORK-COMMITTEE
HEARINGS TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK
The Maine Legislature has finished*
four weeks of its work—and it must
be admitted that to an observer the
amount of business transacted is not
more than in the same length of pre
vious sessions. That is largely on
account of the change in the method
of starting the business of a session,
which is with the Budget hearings, a
proceeding that takes considerable
time and yet does away with many
long hours otherwise and heretofore
given to committee hearings.
The Budget hearings will be com
pleted next week. They will on
Tuesday clean up the matters that
have been assigned but which for
some reason were deferred and also
hear Supt. of Public Schools Dr. A.
O. Thomas, who has tv.o more mat
ters which he wishes to present.
Wednesday will be given to acad
emies. of which Maine has a large
number. The remaining claims up
on the kindness of the State will then
lie heard and it is now planned to
have the Budget in shape for pres
entation to the Legislature and the
public on Tuesday, Feb. 4.
It is also expected that the Senate
committee on elections will make its
report on the Irish-Parent contested
seat matter on Tuesday.
Committee hearings will begin in
earnest next week, the usual number
being assigned.
IN' THE SENATE
Senator Deering of York, under
suspension of the rules, moved that
when the Senate and House adjourn
it be to 10 o’clock Tuesday morning.
President Higgins appointed Sen
ators Gannett of Kennebec and Da

mer Governor Gen. Seliicn Connor

A STATEMENT
! The following statement was
I issued Friday morning by the
newspapermen who are report- !
ing this session of the Legisla
ture:
To Whom It Interests or Con- |
| cerns:
We the newspapermen engaged
in reporting the seventy-ninth
session of the Maine legislature
; for the press of this State to say
that, after a very full investiga
tion, we are convinced that
Turnkey Frank B. Johnson of the
! Androscoggin county jail at Au
burn, in his testimony before the
i Senate election committee on
I Wednesday evening did not
state that a warrant was issued
for the arrest of John D. CUf
j ford, Jr„ of Lewiston, in connec
tion with the election of Septem
j ber 9th, last: that he did not say
this warrant was issued upon :
; complaint of City Clerk Bumpus |
' of Auburn; that he dhl not say i
they were prevented irom sew- j
ing such warrant.
We are further convinced that
the error, greatly regretted by us,
is du? to a mix-up in the notes I
of the man who reported Mr.
Johnson’s testimony. Further we
desire to emphasize the fact that
this man knew neither Mr. Clif
ford or Mr. Johnson and had
never seen either of them, to his
Knowledge, prior to the time Mr.
Johnson went upon the stand.
We make this statement in or
der that Mr. Johnson may be
i placed right in the community
and to show we were acting in
: the best of faith.

Budget Hearing
The Budget hearings Friday morn
ing and afternoon were busy gather
ings, although the attendance was
not as large as it has been, owing
to the storm and so many being oc
cupied with Community Efficiency
Conference matters. Chairman Grant
kept matters moving briskly an<F
while the ground was thoroughly cov
ered it was quickly done. A large
number of hospitals and charitable
organizations were heard and the
meetings adjourned until Tuesday
next. It is practically certain that, the
Budget hearings will be comple’e.i
next week.
Maine General Hospital
Thomas L. Talbot of Portland, a
member of the board of trustees of
the Maine General Hospital, appear
ed at the morning session and pre
senting the request of the trustees
for the same appropriation as that
granted by the Legislature for the
past two years, $7509 for each year,
told of the needs of the institution.
Referring to the free service giv
en, Mr. Talbot stated that it was not
the policy of the hospital officials
to turn any needy away even when
the appropriation was exhausted.
Of the 150 patients who applied far
[free treatment practically all Sfora.
NO TONIC LIKE HOOD’S!
Sarsaparilla For a Time like This,
After Influenza, the Grip.
When purified Wood, rebuilt strength j
and regulated bowels are essential.
In the after-effects of influenza. the !
grip and other prostrating diseases, i
Hood's Sarsaparilla has remarkable
health-helping effect.
It expels the poisons that have weak-1
ened and depleted the blood, causing;
pallor, anemia, flabby flesh and lax ,
muscles. It is the standard blood rem- :
edy with u succtssfull record of nearly :
id years. i
Many people—it is really astonishing ,
how many—need a line, gentle, easy 1
cathartic in these trying times We '•
recommend Hood's Pills, used in the!
best families, and equally effective with
d< ticate women or robust men. Easy 10
lake, easy to operate.—Adv. :
given it, after investigation. He also)
pointed out the increased cost of,
conducting the hospital, stating that j
the cost of coal the past year was j
about $20,000 as compared with $7000 j
or $SOOO the year before. Medical'
supplies also showed corresponding:
advances in prices, costing $11,000 as j
against $7000 or in that vicinity the •
previous year. The deficit last year *
was over $10,000 and the purpose in ;
appearing before the committee, he.
stated, was to make this up as far;
as possible.
“If we were running a business,""
said Mr. Talbot, “we could shut
down and say we would wait until
price conditions were more favorable.
But the hospital has received money
of the charitable people of Maine to j
keep things running as a trust. For'
this reason we are asking the same
amount as granted by the last Leg- j
islaturc.""
Representative Holley of Anson,
a member of the committee, asked
about when investigating relative
to a man s ability to pay, and if
able to pay what method was taken
to get him to pay. “That is. if he
is putting it over on you, so to
speak,” said Mr. Holley.
""Sue him if we have to."" replied
Hr. Charles Smith, superintendent of
the hospital, who was asked by Mr.
Talbot to answer Questions as to
management. He then explained that
tliis was not a common practice, but
that it was necessary to resort to the
courts in some instances. The mat
ter of efforts'to get ravors was also
looked up.
Senator Grant asked if the epi
demic of influenza had cuused an in
crease in expense, and the reply was
that it had.
Ur. Smith explained that the old
infirmary had been used for these
patients, many of whom were poor
people, these patients not coming in
contact with those in the main hos
pital. There were 114 cared for in
the old infirmary since Sept. 1. the
capacity of ir, patients being taxed
much of the time.
Speaking of income, Dr. Smith stat
ed that there had been an advance in
the price of private rooms, which un
der ordinary conditions would have
added greatly to ttie income, but
that as it the increase was $1000.
Representative Rounds of Port
land asked as to the number of free
beds, and he replied that there were
about 26, he would estimate, these
being full most of the time.
Grading Hospital Grounds
Representative Rounds appeared ’
before the committee to urge an ap- 1
propriation for grading the grounds j
ijj the rear ""f the hospital, an esti- 1
nlate of $10,000 for this being submit- 1
tod by him to the committee some1
time ago, when estimates were first j
put in.
“We want the patients to have a
chance to go out and enjoy God s
free air. and to give them a chance
to get well/’ said Mr. Rounds. “We
want an appropriation so that tiiat
ash heap can be turned over and the
grounds made attractive, and the i
patients have a chance to go out and
enjoy the fresh air. The smell of a
hospital is not inviting to a man that
is getting well.”
Representative J. R. Warren of j
Portland thought it advisable to:
make the improvements. Mr. Rounds
ar.d Mr. Warren thought about $2000
would do the work.
Trustee Talbot admitted it was the
first he had heard of the plan and
thought it would he improper for)
the trustees to express any opinion.
Calais Hospital ;
Dr. \V. M. Minor appeared in behalf I
of the Calais hospital, stating that it ;
asked for a.larger appropriation tiian 1
that granted two years ago. $600 for .
each of the years 1917 and 131$. He :
stated that it should receive $2000 !
for each of the next two years. It is |

it. It did a great amount of work J

mainten: cc, the sum of $1000. It has

handed him a copy of notes made »t
the preliminary examination of Hail.
Counsel for the defense read from
these to show that at tlio preliminary
hearing Dr. Traynor testified that deatn
was caused by shock and Internal hem
orrhage of the brain. In reply to ques
tions Dr. Traynor said that he consid
ered himself an authority on perform
ing autopsies, but that prior to that on
Mrs. Hall’s body he never had perform
ed an autopsy on a body which had
been buried TO days and then exhumed.
He said that he bad discussed the med
ical evidence In the case with County
Attorney Franklin R. Chealey. He had
also consulted with Dr. George B. Ma
grath, medical examiner of Suffolk
county. Massachusetts, talking with
him between four and six hours on
Jan. IS. He identified Dr. Magrath as
being present in the courtroom.
”If a person becomes dizzy."" asked
Judge Emery, ‘hs not the head thrust
forward and does not the body follow
in the same direction?""
The witness said that was correct.
He admitted that if a person- fell in
! such a manner that the head struck a
small pebble the scalp might be split.
He was questioned as to changes in the
‘ appearance of a body after death.
These, he said, would vary with dif
ferent bodies after a period of 70 days.
Putrefaction, he said, was first ob
' servable on the esophagus. Dr. Tray
nor said that if a person in failing in
stinctively put out both hands to sat.
his head, the wrists might be frac
tured. Reaction from a fall, he testi
fied. might cause the fracture of a rib.
! Judge Emery's last question before to
( day's session of court ended brought
i from Dr. Traynor the statement that
, if a person's veins broke down as a
resuit of injuries black and blue spun
would result.
The attention of Ernest J. Matthews.
; the section man and first person to av
i rive on the scene after Mrs. Henry
; If. Hall fell from a bridge over a shal
low stream near Wells Depot last June,
was first attracted by the calls of her
husband for help. Matthews testified
on cross-examination today at the trial
of Hall for wife murder. After he hai
! crossed the culvert in hi9 motor car
: and was 30 feet away he heard Hall
shout: ' Earnte Matthews! Stop' Com*
back!""
! Hall walked up the tracks and '.old
lum what had happened, pointing from
the bridge to the patch of coarse crave’
and rocks near the bridge on which Hall
said his wife fell while dizzy. He lo
cated the spot on a diagram. Some
times it is covered with two or three
: inches of water, and at other times it
j is bare as it was when Mrs. Hall fell.
Matthews stated while under direct
examination that Mrs. Hall lay face
j downward, with her head within a fcot
of the third step of the westerly abut,
ment. Her fact not wet. Ho did
: not remember that Hal! made any ex
' amination of her.
Judge George I*. Emery, counsel
' for the accused man. in cross-exam
ination brought out from Matthews
i th.vt her body on the bank, where it
had been taken by Hall from the
! brock, wus headed up the path lead
j :ng to the tracks, indicating that Hal!
j was trying to carry her to the rail
! road. Section men, lie said, frequent
1 !y used this path to visit a spring
j close by.
The Wells Depot station agent. h°
j testified, could see the bridge from
■ the station, three-quarters of a mile
| away,
Matthews noticed a out on Mrs.
Hall's head, discoloration near the
eyes and that her hands were bruind.
Much of the testimony of Matthews
i was rorroborated by his 16-year-old
i daughter, Ida M. Matthews, who was
| with him on the motor c. r. She said
Hall called to her father after they
had passed the spot. She stayed on
j the car. but was able to se?Mrs. Hall,
' face down, on the embankment. The
; first they knew of the presence of
| the couple was when I frit came into
I view and shouted to hjt- father,
j Matthews said that while he and
j Hall were carrying Mrs. Hall to the
j car and had crossed a fence Hall
tripped. As he did so. he stopped and
grabbed her by the wrists to save
himself. He did not see Hall change
his hold on the wrists. He lad been
holding her under the arms. Mat
thews found a ho ire mi', also \ dish
of berries beside it. on e Island.

; Dr. I-awrence E. TYillard in an ambu
. ian.-e and to the embalming of the
j body after death, which took place at
• 2 o'clock the next morning.
' \\'hen he reached the Hall home.

' under the chin and on the wrists. He
: and a deep cut op t-p of tiw head
and a deep hole over the right eye.
on which he put a '.\ai '.ening com
\ pound and plaster. Powder was rub
bed on to discolorations on both sides
of the throat.
Undertaker Mclntire admitted that
w tir-n he put four quarters of embalm
ing fluid into the body it might have
caused discolorations. This might be
avoided by drawing off the blood
slowly. He did not use an excessive
nmoun' of the fluid. Hall did not go
4 • the hospital.
Miss Auror Gouvin of Somersworth.
a nurse at the Webber hospital, where
Mrs. Hall was taken, a. «isrtfed to care
for her, testified that the pulse was
low. No one but the nurses talked
w'it her. Mrs. Hall died half an hour
after arrival. She noticed the discol
orations of the throat. The eyes were
black and blue, the chest was dis
colored and her wrists were brokei
The body was later taken to the X

SAGE TEA DANDY
TO DARKEN HAIR
IU8 Grandmother’s Recipe to Bring
Back Color and Lustre to Hair
You can turn gray, faded hair beau
tifully dark and lustrous almost over
night if you'll get a bottle of “Wyeth's
Sage and Sulphur Compound"" at any
drug store. Millions of bottles of this
old famous Sage Tea K 'cipe. im
proved by the addition of other ingre
dients. arc sold annually, says a well
known druggist here, because it
darkens the hair so naturally and
evenly that no one can tell it has been
arplied.
Those whose hair is turning gray
or becoming faded have a surprise
awaiting them, because after one or
two applications the gray hair van
ishes and your locks become luxuri
antly dark and beautiful.
This is the age of youth. Gray
haired. unattractive folks aren't
wanted around, so get busy with
Wyeth’s Sage and Sulphur Compound
to-night and you'll be delighted with
your dark, handsome hair and your
youthful appearance within a few
days.—Adv.
GROWING DEAF WITH
HEAD NOISES?
TRY THIS
If you are growing: hard of hearing
and fear Catarrhal Deafness or if you
have roaring, rumbling, hissing noises
in your ears go to your druggist and get
1 ounce of Parmint (double strength),
and add to it >4 pint of hot water and a
little granulated sugar. Take 1 table
spoonful four times a day.
This will often bring tjuick relief from
the distressing head noises. Clogged
nostrils should open, breathing become
easy and the mucus stop dropping into
the throat. It is easy to prepare, costs
little and is pleasant to take. Anyone
who is threatened with Catarrhal Deaf
ness or who has head noises should give
this prescription a trial.—Adv.

D. W. Griffith’s Production “Romance
of Happy Valley;” Charlie Chaplin
in “The Love Fiend;” News Week
ly; Strand Comedy; Official Red
Cross Film Entitled “Of No Use to
Germany.” Ten Reel Program To
day
Ranking among the first of Ameri
can producers of stupendous cinema
spectacular productions David Wark
Griffith, creator of the “Birth of a Na
tion,” “Hearts of the World,” “The
Great Love” and other gigantic mo
tion pictures, deservedly has won
world wide fame. Mr. Griffith long
ago demonstrated his artistry and
mastery of cinema technique, hut in
none of his pictures are these qualifi
cations so completely in evidence as
in his latest Artcraft pictures ""A Ro
mance of Happy Valley.” This is a
charming theme delightfully' handled
and doubtless will win its way into
the hearts of an appreciative public.
That it will be acclaimed a classic sec
ond to none produced in recent years
seems to be assured. ?<Jr. Griffith has
chosen with great care the cast in “A
Romance of Happy Valley” and
among others selected are Lillian
Gish, Robert Harron and George
Fawcett, all well known to every one.
Charlie Chaplin will appear in one
of his delightfully funny comedies tn
titled ""A Love Fiend.” It is in this
picture that Mr. Chaplin established
himself as the greatest comedian of
all times.
A series of special Red Cross films
have been secured and one reel each
Wednesday will be shown for the next
few weeks. The first reel which will
bp shown today is entitled “Of no use
to Germany.” It will undoubtedly
prove most interesting.
The balance of the program con
sists of the latest Gaumont News
Weekly and a Strand comedy entitled
“Easy Payments.”
A special matinee will be run at 2.30

Isabel M. Smalley.
| The funeral services of Miss Isabel
j M. Smalley whose untimely death oc
j curred at the home ol' her sister, Mrs.
i K. S. Philbrook, Sunday evening, will
! be conducted at Belfast Wednesday
morning, Feb. a at 10.30 o'clock by
Rev. Charles W. Martin, pastor of the
1‘eople’s Methodist church of Belfast.
Miss Smalley's unexpected death was
a severe shock to the entire commun
ity and was particularly painful to
those who knew her best. She was a
young woman of exceptional attrac
tiveness. Possessed of a pleasing
personality and naturally bright and
happy in disposition, she made
[friends wherever she went. During
thj two months spent in Augusta in
the effort to recover her health, her
j lovable disposition won the affection
of all who in any way came in contact
with her. Besides a brother and
three married sisters in Belfast and a
sister in Augusta, she leaves a host
o loving friends in Belfast, her na
tive town.
Miss Smalley was a pure, beautiful
Christian girl who had everything to
live for and nothing to die tor. l.ong
years of care and anxious toil for her
parents. Eliza Stearns and Alexander
I). Smalley, taxed her mind to the
breaking point. It was hoped that a
change of scene and association
might work a cure. She responded to
the best medical treatment, and ap
peared to be gaining. She attended
church Sunday and partook of the
communion and seemed well and
i cheerful Sunday afternoon. Evident
ly the injury to her mind had been too
| severe, and the break came Sunday
j afternoon at about four o'clock. It
may be truly said that her life was
given nnon the altar of her unselfish
devotion to others.
Card of Thanks ,
We wish to express our heartfelt
thanks to our relatives and friends
for their many kindnesses in our re
cent bereavement. Also we wish to
thank the different orders for their
beautiful floral tributes.

county since Jan. 27 holding a series
of meetings. lie will remain there
until after Feb. 10, on which date
the Aroostook farmers will complete
their county wide organization. The
farming situation in Aroostook is
Quite serious, farmers having made
a loss on their crops of potatoes in
1917 and are now losing on the 1913
crop. Price of fertilizer has gone
up about $19 from last year, so that
the grade of fertilizer they desire to
use will cost them about $X0 per ton,
and as they have to use about a ton
per acre, anyone will readily see
that the cost of raising potatoes in
1919 is going to be very high, with
the prospect in view that next win
ter the selling price may drop to a
low figure. Mr. Adams is holding a
series of about 15 meetings and is
accompanied by a member of the
Market Bureau at Washington.

ohl that its teeth were worn blunt
and the llesh was beginning to shrink
away from the ivory. The cat was
treed Monday by the fox hounds of

SUPREMECOURT
Motion for Non-Suit Is
Granted by Court
In Caw of Clga M. Gordon vs. W.
D. Hutchins and W. ■. Kandall at
tKa Saturday So#*, on—Trial of
Civil Casts Will Bo Rstumsd This
Morning
Defendants motion for non-»'Jit
was granted by Associate Just‘ce
Hansen in the ease of Olga M. Gor
don of Pittston vs. \v. 0. Hutchins
of Augusta and William B. Kendall
of Bowdoinham at the close of plain
tiff s evidence at the Saturday ses
sion of the supreme judicial court
Arguments upon the motion were
made in chambers by Attorney E.
L. McLean of Augusta for the de
fendants and Attorney George V.'.
Heselton of Gardiner for the plain
tiff. The action was one of assump
sit for money had and received, based
on alleged fraud in the sale of a farm
in Whttefleld.
Henry. D. Gcrdon of NortH Hitts
ton, hust-and of the pin ntlJI in the
aetion. resumed his testimony at the
epening of the dav’s session. He tes
tified that up to 1914.he made mo in
quiry as to the cr ips growtf tin the
farm before he went-tSe-e. .ffooa af
ter he ascertamed about tjse hay
crop on the fa. in in l'Jtt h- had tal.t
ed with Mr. Hiit hi.-i. V.Mates sa...
that v. hen he ""bouuht the farm, ic .
irg as agent for Mrs. Gorina, he re
lied upon what Mr. HutcMsW ha .
said regarding the farm produce an :
th* representations of the farm ac
cording to the catalogue and state
ments as to the hay. lumber and
fruit produced. In May. 13:;. he wen:
upon the farm. Mr. Gordon testified
the during the time he lived on the
farm he improved it JiIOO or more and
he told of the improvements he mad
upon the buildjngs and the land He
reeded down one and a quarG.
acres which come up». He took me;,
ures to eradicate hawk weed and he
bought nearly t10) worth of ferrii -
zer. He said that after he found th .
farm didn't cut 25 acres cf hay Vo
spll remained there, relying up-, r
what Mr. Hutchins had said.
t'pon cross-examination by Attor
ney McLean, witness ‘estified that he
had written to tne W. D. Hutch:: -
Co. for the farm catalcgu--, but hr
had not put muc's time in. look, j
over the catalogue. He had not n. -
ticed any difference between the d -
seriptions of the farm in the two cat
alogues from the V.'. D. Hutchins Co
He had received the smaller catalogue
either at the same time or shortly af
ter getting the larger one. He had
read the smaller catalogue to a cer
tain extent. Mr. Barnes, when he had
given the ""ataloguo to Mr. Gordon,
had not told him it was an old cat
alogue. He had not told Mr. Barnes
he would like to have some pictures
cf the farm ""Sunnyside"" to take
home and show his people, hut i e
had asked for some of the catalugues
to take home. H? had told Mr Barnes
in substance that he would take the
farm if he could sell his property at
Sullivan, and he had then made ef
forts to sell his Sullivan property. He
said that not until 1914 did he con
demn Mr. Hutchins for any m^rep
resentations. He expected to get u5
tons of hay on the farm. The soil was
good, but needed a lot of dressing.
During and after the hay crop of 1314
he first become acquainted with the
.alleged fraud. In answer lo the ques
tion. what induced him to try to ir.di.e
a compromise, witness sad it was
because he found it impossible to
qarry on the farm on the income and
he had been deceived. Witness re
called having testified at prev: us tri
al that the first t-me h* went to -he
farm ""Sunnyside"" he discovered thero
was no telephone at the house. When
he had first visited the farm with
Barnes he had seen that the orchard
reeded attenti n. and that the whole
place needed attention. A letter from
Mr. Hutchins had stated that the
orchard had been w -rked by pig
several years previously. On several
occasions when he saw Mr Barons
it was pure accident. Witness thoug.it
that in his letters to Mr. Hutchins he
had mentioned what people had said
about the place in 1914. He testified
regarding lumber he had sold from
the farm.
Mr. Gordon upon re-direct examina
tion testified that he had transplant
ed 12 standing apple tree on the place
and had paid $1 apiece for them be
sides the freight. Regarding the •-•oil
cessions in 1913. witness said that then
he did not have any knowledge of the
past history of the hay cut cn the
farm. The apple crop of 1513 was a
failure and that of 1314 was not
much better. Witness testified aboiut
DRUGGISTS! ViCK'S VAPORUB
SHORTAGE OVERCOME AT LAST
The Deal Scheduled For Last
November, Which Was Post*
poned on Account of the In*
fluenza Epidemic, Is Now
Re-instated — Good During !
the Month of March.
OVER ONE MILLION JARS
OF VAPORUB PRODUCED 1
EACH WEfcK. I
It is w.th pride that we announce
to the drug trade that the shortage ;
of Vick’s VapoRub, which has lasted i
since last October, is now oyercome.!
Since January' 1st. we have been run- :
nine our laboratory twenty-three and |
a half hours out of every twenty- [
four. Last week we shipped the last'
of our back orders, and retail drug
gists, therefore, are no longer request
ed to order in small quantities only.
NOVEMBER DEAL RE-INSTATED
This deal, which we had expected ■
to put on last November and which j
had to be postponed on account of the *
shortage of VapoRub, is re-instated
for the month of March. This allows 1
a discount of on shipments from
jobbers' stock of quantities of from
I to 4 gross, art, of this ditcount is !
allowed by the jobber and 5c» by us. J
We advise the retail druggists to j
place their orders immediately, so1
that the jobbers will be able to get
prompt shipments to them.
Thanks of the Public Duo the Drug
Trado During the Influenza
Epidemic
The thanks of the American public
are certainly due the entire drug
trade—retail, wholesale and mJIm- !
facturing—for what they accom- .
plished during the recent influenza I
epidemic. The war caused a shortage ,
cf physicians—nurses were almost
impossible to obtain—the demand on
the drug trade was unexpected and t
overwhelming, and to this demand
they responded nobly. Retail drug- :
gists kept open day and night and .
slept where they droppod behind th >
prescription counter. Wholesale
druggists called their salesmen off the
road to help fii! orders—hundreds
wired us to ship Vick's VapoRub by
the quickest route, regardiesa of ex
pense. j
A TREMENDOUS J03 TO
INCREASE OUR PRODUCTION
In this emergency we have tried to
do our part. We scoured the country
for raw materials—our Truffle Man
ager spent hi* days riding freight
oars in we shipped raw materials in
carload lots by express and pleaded
with manufacturers to increase their
deliveries to us. -
But it was a slow proceac. Seme
cf our raw materials are produced
only m Japan—supplies to this coun
try were lew and shipments required
three months to come from the Far
Blast. Then we had to recruit and
train shilled labor. We brought cur
salesmen into the factory and trained
them as foremen. We invented new
machinery', and managed to install it
on Christmas Day. so as not to in
terfere with our daily production.
143 JARS OF VAPORUB EVERY
MINUTE DAY AND NIGHT
Ey January 1st we had everything
ready to put on our night shift, and
since then our laboratory has been
running day and night. To feed our
automatic machines, which drop out
one hundred and forty-three jars of
VapoRab a minute or one million and
eighty thousand weekly, has required
a force of 550 people. Our Cafe De
partment. created for the benefit of
these worke. served 7000 meals dur
ing the month of January alone.
13 MILLION JARS OF VAPORUB
DISTRIBUTED SINCE OCTOBER
An idea of the work we have ac
complished this fall may be given by
our production figures—13.025.97S jars
of VapoRab manufactured and dis
tributed since last October—one jar
for every t- -o families in the entire
United States.
During the influenza epidemic. Vick's
VapoRub was used as an exterra! ap
plication in connection with the
physician's treatment, and thousands
of people, unable to obtain a doctor,
relied on Vick's almost exclusively.
Literacy millions c-f
famines ail over the coun
try. from California to
Maine, and from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf,
have found Vick's Vapo
Rub the ideal home rem
edy for croup ana cold
troubles. j

The next witness was John. R. Dunn

ty SHOO. He said the orchard was
poor, the trees being scrubby. W.t
. re=s upon cross examination said he
had never teen in the orchard but
; had seen it from the road. He tesli
I tied that in giving his estimate of th»
I fair rental of the place he considered
that the man who was best able
should pay the insurance.
Thomas Ward of Whitefield testi
fied that he had Jived on th- farm in
j *00?, renting it of Mr. Hutchins. He
• considered a fair value of the farm
; on May 5. 1012. about $1300. He said

building fences there. He had helped
Mr. Gordon plant. Mr. Gordon had
' u«ed phosphate and dressing for fer

good olnglish hay grown cn the
place. He had seen the crops in 19U
1 and 1914 ar.d considered that Mr.
! Gordon had managed the farm in a
i go:d husbandlike manner, increasing
its value altogether about 1500. He
had seen the hay in the barn which
, was cut on the farm in 1911 and he
estimated it at eight tons. Witness
. upon cross-examination testified re
garding the wood cut off the place
adn he estimated the timber cut off at
' from. 40,900 to 33,000 feet, saying that
his previous estimate at from 7*.000
' to l«o nco was too high. He testified
that Mr Hutchins had made some
’ improvements oh the farm and he
i told of what he considered running
the farm in a husbandlike manner.
! He estimated that the improvement
i of the farm in the plowing, tillage

PROBABLE ARRIVAL
26TH BY MIDDLE APRIL
fiov^rnor Millikan Saturday re
ceived a tetter fr m Brigadier Ger.
rrgi Otarles H. Cole, of the 52nd In- •
fantry Brigade. American Expedi
tionary Forces which #ays:
I have just read some Boston pa
pers of the latter part of January
and from what they say I fear that
the people at home have not yet got
ten a clear idea of just what the
j'tih Division is doing and what or
ders have been received.
•V.'e have received orders to Vtart
for home which means that if the
schedule is followed we should take
a beat about the first of April. No
units from this division have jet.
gone home nor are ar.j- expected to
go until the dates l have mentioned
above. The only members of the di
vision now at home are wounded
men and casuals.
“I hope the division will be given
an opportunity to parade as a di
vision in the streets of Boston in or
der that its families, its friends and •
New England r.ay se* them in their
fighting form.
""On Wednesday last the <1-vision
was reviewed by General F- rshir.g—
f-'-r the fi:st and only time sine-* its
organisation i- was gathered tec- 'It
er at one place. I have seer. man>
spectacles in my life but I believe
that this was the most magnificent
pectacle that. I hav* ever seen. A
great solid body of 25,*•'■«> men in full
war palioploj. with helmets, parks
and fix- i hat ->n-ts and i in ail the
regimental binds consol.datinto
one. The appearance ana effect of a
tremendous force and pew r was
everywhere apparent as thus great
body of m- n nsov- 1 against the dark
green background.
""For your ir format ion the division
,s practically fuiL About 2S.0a""'men
■ r.> now ng jhe rolls and tv a expect
to bring them all home. Present or
3e-s state that even those men who
do not reside in New England will be
sent home with the division and then
sent to their own states, after arrival
• n America. If we land in Boston,
this would mean that the whole <1.
. . -ion would go to Cair.n D< ven.«
men from outside New ErgUird ns
we!! as those from New Eng'und. and
that the men outs.de of New Eng
land would then be sent horn- from
(""amp Tevens. If we land in New
York, however it may t that the
rr.-n outside New Eng’snd would 'o
sent '.eotly home from New York.
I hop.- v. e shall be fortunate enough
to I ind ;n Host r_
' I doiih* verj much if the division

TOBACCO USERS “HIT
New Revenue Law Irc-eares Price
and Decreases the Quantity
I.'cal Timers of tobacco. both
?mokers srd ch.ewers of the w»ed.
together w;th others all over the
country, must now pay mere for
their tobacco.
Uncle Sam’s new revenue bill for
six billion dollars has commerced its
effect on “luxuries""—and tobacco
users are the first victims. Augusta
has noticed it.
Every variety of tobacco is affect
ed: Snuff, cigars cigarettes, pipe to
bacco and chewing: tobacco—alt come
under the new “luxury* ""tax. Only an
estimate can be riven of the new
prices. f'lgarrttcs that retailed for
seven cents are new <dght cents: 1'J
cent cigarettes are 13 cents: and cig
arettes that were 15 cents a package
are now li. The imported c.garotte
—which usually se'ls for 30 cents a
package—will probably retail no’v
for a price in the vicinity of 40
cents. Cigars ar° affected in bke
manner. Ptalrrs that made it a cus
tom bo give thre° cigars for a quar
ter will now sell only two for the
same price, the six-cent cigar is now
seven cents: ami so on. Even the
man with his staunch old standby—
“friend pipe”—has an additional
amount to pay for his favorite tin
of tobacco.
The chewer of tobacco is in the
some class, and the plug of “chew
ing"" now sold, and at a higher price,
looks like a sampie that tobacco men
used to distribute occasionally com
pare«r with the standard aU« that

Ten minutes later he cried for food and re*

COAL FACTS
• •
To those who are hoping for big price reduction:
We are in the coal business. We believe we
know conditions. Frankly we cannot predict
future prices, No one can. While we do not
think substantial reductions are likely, there
are many factors that may bring1 about some
reduction.
Wages at the mines'may be reduced. Freight
rates may be reduced. On the other hand,
there may be serious labor troubles; public
utilities in New York City have recently faced
a “close-down” because of inability to get coal.
Cause: harbor strikes.
The wise consumer orders now and takes a
fair share of his year’s coal supply under ex
isting price conditions; he provides himself
against a recurrence of the horrible conditions
of two years ago. If wide-spread labor trou
bles arise at the coal mines during the coming
season, who can measure the value of the coal
already in your cellar?
We consider ourselves in partnership with the
consumer. It is our function to get his coal to
him. We advise him to take it during the open
weather and as quickly as convenient. We
know no more of what the future holds than
the consumer does.
BUY YOUR COAL NOW AND CEASE
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

places where they are greatly needed
abroad. Miss Ros3 stated that the Red
Crbss has started on its peace pro
gram. a part of which is to be a great
health program, and she spoke cf the
different kinds of health work.

of heaith work by the lay haaltll j
workers.

ANNUAL MEETING
ASSOCIATED PRESS
IN NEW YORK CITY
New York. April 22—Development
of intercommunication promises a
chance that the League of Nations
may accomplish its object of insur
ing- world peace. Melville E. Stone,
general manager of the Associated
Press, recently returned from the
Peace onferer.ee. told the members
of the news association at their a:i
r.aui meeting and luncheon here to
day.
Mr. Stone doubted if any body
knew whether the Leane project
would succeed, but sa.d the repre
sentatives of the associated powers
had addressed themselves to the for
mation of an organization intended,
if possible, to prevent a recurrence
cf war, which, he said, had reached
a point, through the advance of sci
ence. where a future eon diet would
well-nigh mean human annihilation.
By the modern processes of imer
commun.cation however, the nations
were nevitably brought closes to
gether. he said, extending men *
visions and giving ""a little prcni.sc'
that the failure of the Congress of
V enna 10"" year* ago might he f <I
lowed by something like success.""
It was a mistake, he said, ’o im
agine that iad been an ir.plea.-ant
•»r angry situation between the
pea e envoys of the associated pow
ers who had brought to their task
a sincere iesire to solve a great
problem. Despite the German hon«s
of d Terence among the conquerors,
he added, they had agreed to prin
ciple. Describing a visit to the de
vastated r-gions of France, Mr.
Stone declared it had been hem !>y
t..e most malign and outrageous
sa i-t-.-ry ’ the world had ever
am vn. To bring about its rehabii
Itati-m. lie asserted, extention of
leng time credits by American man
ufacturers was essertial, a scheme
which :e sa:<i could be carried out
througa the banks, with the Federal
Reserve -ystem to fail back upon
in cas“ ""f emergency.
In keeping with the Pan-American
spirit of the meeting inspired by the
recent addition of 25 Smith American
newspapers to the Associated Press
membership, Mr. Stone stated tha.
this -*xtension of the service gave as
surance at the amity of the western
hemisphere. In like manner in ear
lier days, he said, the organization
had been a material factor in ce
menting tlie relations of the North
ern and Southern sections of t.-.e
United States, a union made possi
ble the National spirit evidenced
in the Spanish-Amencan and re
emphasizing in the world conflict.
Frank B Noyes, president cf the as
sociation. who ac'ed as toastmaster,
expressed the belief that when the
peace »erms were made public it would
be found that despite a!! the -lashes of
national interests America w.i! have
made good h ?r word. ""
""On this annual arcas'on."" Mr Xoyss
said. ""It is our eustom to drink but one
tea t.
T give you the health of the Presi
dent of the United States. Woodrow
Wi!«en.""

ctor.e. pa d tribute to the working staff

daily kennebec journal.,['Augusta'],1919-04-29,"The Cost of Roofing
! Figure the cost of roofing by its cost per years service and not
by its price per roll. The kind of roofing that you want is the
kind that’s easiest to lay, that lasts the longest and takes the
least labor to keep in repair. That roofing is Ru-ber-oid.
has been manufactured for morethan
a quarter century by The Standard
Paint Company. It was the first
prepared roofing on the market. It
has hosts of enthusiastic friends in
nearly every country in the world:
formers, manufacturers, railroad men,
plantation owners, men who own
smelters and chemical works; they
have all tested it thoroughly under
actual working conditions and have
found that it equalled (and in a
I great many cases excelled) their
I expectations.
But remember—you cannot tell how
long a roofing is going to last by
looking at it. It is easy to make a
roofing of cheap material that looks
just like Ru-ber-oid but it will not
ru.earlike Ru-ber-oid. So don’t be
influenced by “looks” or “feel” but
buy the roofing that you know is
going to give you honest sendee for
the money that you pay.

prices. We have a stock of Ru- j
ber-oid ready for your needs. I
There is but one Ru-ber-oid.

HOW TO BE RID OF
ominous dabpbuff
If you have dandruff you must get
rid of it quick—it's positively danger
ous and will surely ruin vour hair If
you don’t.
Dandruffy heads mean faded, brit
tle. scraggly hair that finally dies and
fails out—new hair will not grow—
then you are hairless and nothing can
help you.
The only sure wav to abolish dan
druff for good is to destroy the germ
that causes it. To do this quickly,
surely and safely, and at little «*
pense. there is nothing so effective as
Parisian sage, which you can get
from good druggists everywhere. It
is guaranteed to banish dandruff,
stop itching scalp and falling hair,
and promote a new growth, or the
cost, small as It is. will he refunded.
Parisian sage Is a scientific prep
aration that supplies all hair needs—
an antiseptic liquid neither sticky or
greasy, easy to apply, and delicately
perfumed.
If you want beautiful soft, thick,
lustrous hair, and lots o‘f It, by all
moans use Parisian sage. Don’t delay
—begin tonight—n little attention
now insures abundant hair for years
to come.

Clement W. Wescot'., the committee of
one to handle the Victory Liberty Loan
Drive in Belfast, received material assist
ance from the Belfast Savings Bank and
the Waldo Trust Company. He planned,
worked and talked practicaiiy day and
night until Belfast had reached her quota
of $193,500 and then exceeded it by $32,
000. Mr. Wescott was also county chair
man of the men’s committee and succeed
ed in placing a town chairman in all of
the 25 towns, but later several resigned.
After completing the work in Belfast he
autoed to the towns that had not reached
their quotas and used the same enthus
iasm that Belfast had profitted by. May
12th he had the pleasure of knowing that
every town in the county had reached
then quotas. The county as a whole had
exceeded its quota several days before
and was the second county to report to
j State Chairman Rounds of Portland.
Knox county was the first. Waldo cour.
1 ty’t allotment was $410,800, but was ex
I ceeded by $139,300_Mrs. Sumner C,
I Pattee, who has been acting vice chair
! man for Waldo County in the absence of
■ Mrs. Charles Bradbury in New York, re
ports a total of 518 subscriptions and
the amount of $174,200. Mrs. Pattee has
also received a letter from Mrs. Grace A.
Wing, State chairman, saying that there
has been a radical change ordered in re
gard to the distribution of the German
cannon medals. Their distribution will
be based on the work done in the five
loans instead of the fifth alone. This
will cause some delay as complete lists
must be forwarded to each State chair
man by the sub-chairmen. The medals
for Waldo county will come to Mrs. Pattee
' and she will send them to the town chair •
men for distribution. Belfast’s honor roll
is in manuscript and will be printed in
our next issue.
Herbert W. Healey of this city has sold
his cottage at Temple Heights which he i
built some years ago to Fairfield parties !
who will occupy it this summer season.
James F. Sheldon, who recently bought
the A. S. Heal place on Cedar street, is
doing some very tine work in his home
garden. He has peas several inches
high and stocky. He also has radishes
and lettuce well developed.
Augustus C. Knight, formerly of Bel
fast, who has been at the Florida Sani- 1
tariuin for some time, writes under date ]
of May ltith that he will leave this week
for Boulder, Colo , where he will enter
the Boulder Sanitarium. He can not
stand the climate at Orlando.
Charles Bradbury, president of the
Northport Country Club, writes from
New York, that he plans to have the
formal opening of the club a week earlier ■
than usual on Sunday, June 29th, with a
hand concert. He also plans to have the
first dance of the season Friday night,
July 4th. They will be continued every
other Friday for the season with music
by McKeen’s orchestra. The Golf Club
membership has been increased this sea
son, with new members from Belfast.
Grow Poppies Red for Our Honor
ed Dead. Lieut.-Col. John McCrae of
Montreal in his beautiful poem, “We
Shall Not Sleep,” written while the sec
ond battle of Ypres was in progress, lias
immortalized the red poppy fields of Flan
ders, where his own body now lies. The
Boston Herald’s calendar distributed early
in the year, with its colored picture illus
trating this poem also with its text and
brief explantory notes to be treasured by
all who appreciate the artistic, struck
the key note of using poppies red for our
honored dead. In a recent note to Mrs.
F. G. Spinney, Mrs. Charles Bradbury
writes of another happy thought along
this line. Mrs. Bradbury said that she
with Mrs. Kate Bickford Self were guests
of Mrs. John H. Judge, a frequent Bel
fast visitor, at a card party given by the
Criterion Club of New York. At their
table was a lady who had conceived the
idea of planting in public ana private
gardens all over the United States a bed
of red poppies and in its center placing
the Stars and Stripes to show we have
not broke faith with those who died on
Flanders fields. Mrs. Bradbury also re
quested that the thought be given to the
newspaper in her home city and county.
Arthur P. Barnes, who was recently
heard before Judge Maurice W. Lord of
the Municipal Court for using threatening
language, when it was alleged he said he
would kill his grandfather, Albert Harvey,
and burn his buildings, and released on
probation, was again before the Court
Monday afternoon. This time complaint
was made against him by Sheriff Frank
A. Cushman for the alleged larceny of a
watch, suit case and a pair of pants, from
Kenneth Conner of Castine, a youth of
18 years who is employed here in the shoe
factory, and rooms in the Moody house
on Spring street. The respondent hired
a room of Mrs. Moody on the night of
May 16th and left the t7th. Barnes, aged
18 years, was arraigned and plead not
guilty, but claimed that the articles were
stolen by one, Wilbur Wright, who he
thought belonged in Burnham, but had
been at work with him at the Hubbard
fertilizer plant at Mack’s Point. Mr.
Conner, Sherilf Cushman and Deputy J.
A. G. Beach were called as witnesses.
Mr. Conner identified his property and
the officers told of finding the respondent
i near Holmes’ Mills Sunday and later at
' his father’s home in Waldo recovering
| the goods. They have been searching
: for Wright for this case and also on the
1 charge of Augustus Larrabee of Sears
I port, who alleges that he took a suit of
new clothes and shirts belonging to him
I before leaving Searsport. Judge Lord
found probable cause to hold Barnes un
, der $500 bonds for his appearance at the
September term of the Supreme Judicial
Court and he was placed in the custody
of Sherilf Cushman until he could secure
bondsmen.

from the advanced time. Various
farm activities, it is said, must co
ordinate with clock tune in adjacent
towns and cities. Farmers, it is ex
plained. must deliver produce to
trains, frequently early in the morn
ing. If the fanners work by sun
time, in order to meet ground condi
tions. milking cows, etc.. It is said
they suffer hardship in rising and
working a.-. fciur earlier in order to
load wage ns of produce to meet
trains. They »iw» declare cows
chickens and other farm animals
cannot adjust themselves to the new
clock time but require attention ac
cording to natural custom and sun
time hours.
""The rooster crews regardless of
the daylight saving law,” one farm
er deiared in a petition to Congress
Mothers’ objections to the daylight
law are based upon confusion of con
ditions in the home and. fundament
ally . loss of sleep by children. They
declare children are wakened an
hour earlier than usual under the
law and lose another hour’s sleep
at night, because of refusal or ina
bility to sleep during daylight of the
evening. These conditions, it is said,
cause loss of weight, fretfulness,
nervous trouble and other ailments
of children—and the mothers, too,
from contact with the children.
Protests against the law from la
bor unions and workingmen are based
upon the requirement of the daylight
law for earlier rising.- Wives of
workingmen, it is said, are compelled
aften to rise before daylight and pre
pare breakfast by artificial light.
Seme labor unions say the hoar’s
added daylight at the er.d of the day
does not compensate for the loss of
sleep and early-morning hardships
of the advanced clock time.
Rural school authorities object to
the law because, they say, it jS a
hardship both on pupils and teach
ers. who often have to walk from
one to six miles to school and must
arise before daylight to arrive on
time.
Objections of town and city offi
cials are varied. Some towns in ag
ricultural regions, observing farmers'
opposition to the law. have refused
to adjust their clocks. Maintenance
of the ""old” time in such towns
causes confusion in meeting -trains
and other civic affairs. Other mu
nicipalities. principally In the mid
dle western time zone, passed ordi
nances advancing time pieces an
hots-, adopting time standards of
the eastern zone, before the day
light saving law was enacted. The
law, therefore, required these /’cen
tra! time’’ cities to advance* their
time pieces still another hour. Some
observed and some declined to ob
serve the Saw, making for further
confusion.

contend that really an economic loss

curtailed and that while fuel and
light are saved in cities there is a
greater loss on farms, where lamps

set of reservations shown to sena
tors by Mr. Lodge. It was said he
did not aggressively advocate their
adoption, but merely asked the
opinion of several senators regard -
them. It is understood that they
differ in p fcraseology from those
drafted by the seven senators under
the lead of Senator McXary. but
that some of the seven were most
favorably' impressed by them.
Mr. Ledge has not publicly com
mitted himself, however, in favor
of a reservation program as against

to the treaty.
One of many conferences of the
day was held late this afternoon at
Mr. Lodge's office and Senator Mc

HOME COL BOOTHBY IN MO OF
WATERVILLE WOMAN'S ASSO'N
Harkins back to three years ago.
the revival of a delightful occasion
was the garden party which was held
Tuesday afternoon and evening at
the beautiful home of Col. and Mrs.
F. E. Boothfcy on upper Colleg e ave
nue, for the benefit of the building
fund of the ^""aterville Woman’s As

ly offer? 1 tho best weather of the
season and the spacious grounds of
the Boothby home afforded the prop

The lloothby home Is one of the
show places of this locality and has
been in days past the scene of many
pretty events, and the garden party
«>f Tuesday, in spit? of the fact that
it had been three times postponed,
sustaiv 1 the reputation of social en
terprises that that place.
In the Boothby barn the walls are
literally papered with thp photographs
of famous singers, musicians and
artists of nctc who have been in
Maine, who have appear dat Maine
Festivals and who count themselves
as friends of the delightful Colonel
and Mro. Boothby. A stage is also
in the oam and here i) was that
the entertainment, which was large
ly by children, took place. The
Boothby home, a treasure trove of
artique and costly equipment, was
specially decorated for the garden
party. The dicing roo mwas convert
ed into a Japanese tea room. Japa
nese prints, lanterns and screens
added to the effect.
The ’jooths. which were the center
of interest of the garden party, were
arranged in the rear of the home.
Ice cream, candles and drinks were
on sale. A very pretty picture was
the scene with the ladles and children
in their bright colored summer
dresses.
Whatever cnes fate Is cr ought to
he the fortune teller was there to
tell all about It. and in the log cabin
tehind the Boothby home, where the
fortune teller had her quarters,
crowds were gathered during y the
afternoon and eveniifg, eager to'hear
what was in Store for them.
The Lemon Lady was an usual a
feature of the day and there chil
dren especially hovered around, anx
iously awaiting their turn for a grab.
This booth was in charge of the la
dies of ihe Post Office Auxiliary and
Mrs. Everett Farwell, Mrs. Harry
Higgins, Mrs. Parker Foss, Mrs.
Mearl Varney. The ladles realized
a good sum from this booth ~~ •
The ""white elephant"" table, which
had been so highly advertised, was in
deed s success in every way, and the
ladles were fortuaate In having an au
tomobile party composed of New York
people visit their booth and there pur
chase numerous articles. The visitors
remarked that they were there to epeni
money and the ladies in charge of the
table said that they did certainly spend
money. The table displayed several an
tique articles which would be highly
prised by most people. At this tabto
wsrs also preserves, fsney work and
in fact every kind of an article. This
booth was presided over by representa
tives from the different churches in the
city.
The Friendly Rival ladles served
lunches in the Japanese tea room and
Mrs. Charles Ayer and Mrs. George P.
Johnson were in charge, assisted by thj
following young ladies who were cos
tumed in Japanese gowns and who act
ed their part to perfection: Misses

the flrst articlss to sail.- and the eon
fectlonery went like hot cakes. The
table. was in charge of Mrs. Coney
Brown, Mrs. Edgar Brown, Mrs. George
Voee and Mrs. Irving Staples.
E. A. Vose with hot buttered popcorn
made a hit during the afternoon and
evening and he. was kept busy a great
er part of the time in preparing the de
licious popcorn, which was sold at five
cents a bag.
Misses Bertha Cobb and Maude Her
ron served cake to the public at five
cents a piece, and this table was next
to the ice cream table, cake always
adding the finish to ice cream. The la
dies it* charge of the ice cream were
Mrs. C. Albert Allen, Miss Allen. Mrs.
Hutchinson, Miss Warren. Mrs. Newell
and Mrs. C. D. Bishop.
The well equipped barn, which is
so famous to citizens far and near,
was .the scene of the show for the
day, and for the price of a dime
tlfere was a continuous performance
and each time the room was filled
and many standing. Most of those
who participated in the program
were members of the younger set,
and the Uttle girls and boys dis
played promising stage talent both
In the afternoon and evening.
The program opened each time
with a selection by the orchestra
from the Myrtle street school and
there was not a musician there over
14 years of age, and many very
much younger. The director was
Miss Katherine. Prince who is also a
worker at the play grounds.
The entertainment consisted of
solo dances and vocal selections, and
each number received hearty ap
plause from the house. The num
bers were as follows: ’“Autumn,""

The members of the committee are:
Mrs. Charles Pooler, .Mrs. Max
Clark, Miss Katherine Prince, and
they were assisted by Miss Alice

In the evening the grounds were
crowded and as far as could be
seen were automobiles parked on
either side of the street, and in some
cases in double column. Headquar
terstnan Scribner of the Waterviile
police department was right on the
job and kept everything orderly as
far as traffic was concerned and
proved very efficient for it was not
an easy position to hold.
The Waterviile Military Band, un
der the leadership of W. D. Haines,
gave a very pleasing band concert
in the evening and was the center
of attraction,, for where the Water
viile band is fAund, there is always
a big throng of people.
By 9 o'clock In the evening most
i of the articles were sold, In fact
| earlier than that many of the booths
wets closed. The crowd remained un

Police in Boston
Under Advisement
Boston. Aug. 26.—Police Commissioner
Curtis, after hearing arguments by
counsel tor the police department and
for the principal officers and two other
members of the newly formed police
men's union, took under advisement to
day the cases of the union men. They
were tried before the commissioner on
charges of having violated a depart
ment rule by joining the union.
In connection with the union's tt
forta to obtain recognition by the de
partment, Timothy Healy of New fork,
president of the International Brother
hood of Stationary Firemen and Oilers,
said here tonight that if the members
of his organisation asked permission to
strike In sympathy with the policemen,
he would grant sanction “by long dis
tance telephone, as the telegraph wou’J
be too slow.”
“The revolution to win American
freedom,” said Mr. Healy. ""started 'n
Boston, and unless Commissioner Cur
tis changes his tactics very soon the
revolution for American industrial free-,
dom will also start here, as organised
labor is a unit in this fight of the po
licemen for their constitutional rights
and the treatment that human beings
deserve.”

""SPANISH SWINDLE”
Evidence That It Is Still Bsing
Worked Through the Mails—Au
gusta Man Receives Letter from
Spain Telling the Old Story
It appears that the old “Spanish
Swindle"" is .still being worked
through the mail. Postmaster Fred
erick W. Plained received a call last
week from a well-known Augusta
contractor who hail received a let
ter from Sr«in containing the old,
old story of the fortune on deposit
in the United States and of the po
litical prisoner and his beautiful
daughter.
Postmaster Plaisted turned to the
Postal Guido of several years ago,
stating that the letter had the very
familiar tdunti of the old scheme
which was werked so much about 30
years ago. Below is the warning
which the United States Postofflce
Department sent otfk to the people
in i»14:
“The attention of postmasters is
directed to the scheme set forth be
low, followed by swindlers operating
in various towns and cities in Spain
who nuke a practice of writing to
persons in the United States. The
scheme has also been operated in
Mexico. It is desired that this in
formation be communicated to the
public through the medium of the
I robs • ••••.
""The scheme consists of sending
letters to certain persons, who have
previously been selected by confed
erates. The foundation of the plot
varies somewhat. In some instances
♦he writer represents himself as a
dying prisoner in a military fortress.
has a fortune on deposit in the
United States, but the certificates of
stock are concealed In a secret re
ceptacle i-f his valise which has been
seized by the Spanish Court and will
be held until the prisoner, or his
representative, has satisfied the cost
of the trial. He claims distant re
lationship with the addressee. If'ths
?rst letter bears fruit, it Is quickly
followed by others in which the
prisoner's daughter plays a promi
nent part. She Is in Spain without
a protector. A proposal is made to
send her, accompanied by a priest,
to the newly found relative for pro
tection, if enough money Is sent to
release the valise containing the se
cret receptacle and the certificate* of
deposit. If Ihe relative will accept
the trust he is to receive one-fourth
of the prisoner's entire fortune of
ebout 120,000 pounds. Of course, the
“relative"" never hears from the
swindlers after he has sent the money
requested.
“Under the Spanish laws a felony
must be consummated before the po
lice may act, and a mere attempt to
obtain money by false pretenses does
rot appear to warrant arrest. The
money must be actually paid over,
end the prosecuting witness must be
preeent in person to testify; other
wise prosecution would be useless.""

Prod W. Englehart
Edward W. Anthoine of Portland ap
peared for Fred W. Englehart of Port
land, saying he appeared primarily for
the Red Cross, which brought the mat
ter to his attention, and secondly for
Englehart, serving a sentence for non
support. He escaped from jail after
serving five weeks, went away and
when the war came enlisted, served his
time and came home, saying his army,
experience had changed his views. He
gave himself up and Is serving out hla
sentence. He brought home ISO and
gave his wife 1100, spending the rest
on his family.
Letters were read from Louise B.
Powers of the Rer Cross urging a par
don; from his wife. Xellie F., saying
her husband was a changed man and
she needed his help, being sick with
rheumatic fever, and from the- county
commissioners of Cumberland stronglv
favoring a pardon.
His army record Was excellent The
county attorney authorized Mr. An
thoine to say he was neither In favor
nor opposed, and the sheriff the same.
Mrs. Burnham, the matron, is opposed,
having no faith in his reformation.
Taylor, If pardoned, can secure
v.-ork. lie is a good wood worker
and healthy man.
Blaine Morrisoif, county attorney
of Frantclln county, said he felt It
his duty to oppose a pardon of Tay
lor, for he believed it ono of most
cold-blooded murders in that county.
The facts a« ) understand them are
that Unylor, who lived in Freeman,
was of had reputation, u notorious
character. John Sabine lived in Sa
lem; also sister-in-law. Guida
Searles. Taylor, having double with
wife, became infatuated with Searles.
and began scheming to get rid of
wife. * _/ ■'
On May 11. 1911, Taylor and wife
were alone. He left to go to Searles
woman. Wife followed. He went
hack with her, grabbed an ax and
hit her on heed—several Hows. Back
of head was gone when body was;
found. We contend there could have
been no self-defence. Taylor drag
ged body away and tried to wash
off blow. Got quilt, wrapped up body
and took it into house. Then went
tc Salem to see woman, returning
home and staying* in house with body
of dead wife. Two nights later, as
sisted by Searles woman and Sabin,
buried the body.
Mr. Morrison read *a letter from
Taylor to Sheriff W. B. Small of
Franklfn county on Aug. 13. 1912, aft
er being sent, to prison, in which he
rehearsed all the trouble with his
wife and how he murdered her. as
outlined by Mr. Morrison, the dis
posal of the body and other grew
some. cold-blx>d details of the crime.
A lengthy petition in opposition to
& pardon, signed by citizens of Free
man and Salem, was presented by
Mr. Morrison, the petitioners saying
they thought Taylor guilty and not
sufficiently punished. The three se
lectmen of Freeman and 47 others
signed it. Every signer knew Taylor
for several years before the murder.
Sheriff W. B. Small substantiated
all the statements of County Attorney
Morrison. The body was found in an
18-ineh hole, no covering but dirt and
rocks, just a month after death. Tay
lob conferred to tho county attorney.
In my hearing, of killing the woman
and didn't say anything about self
defence.
Cyrus N. Blanchard of Wilton,
county attorney who prosecuted
Taylor. When she was missing we
suspected something wrong, investi
gated and Anally located the body,
which Taylor Anally Identified. In a
later interview at jail, be confessed
to me that he killed his wife and
made no mention of self-defence. Said
be killed her because ho wanted
Guida Searles to come there and
live with him. _

bine, were In the case. She was indict,
ed as an accessory but case was not
prossed. Sabins was tried as an acces
sory and was acquitted. Mrs Searles
made trouble in the family-. Matters
went from bad to worse and Taylor
sought idlvorcs. lira Searles often car
ried liquor to house. Mrs Tty lor
drank.
Thd fatal row occurred over a Job M
fence work, he claiming she struck him.
cutting h'm with a shovel; then second
time, knocking him down.
Guida Searles appeared, took up to
ax from ths wheelbarrow and as Mrs
Taylor rushed for him. Mrs Searleo
struck the shovel from her hand tod
as Mrs. Taylor reached for the tpads
Guido struck her frcm behind and they
when she was on the ground. Sabin*
then appeared and told Guida not to
strike again. Mrs. Taylor was dead.
Satlne buried the remains. A passerby
that night was told they were out
skunk shooting.
Taylor soya that Guida Ssaries
If he connected her with the act Iks
would kill him. Sabine also threatened
him. Gu da Searles then took Mrs
Taylor’s clothes, watch, etc., and Nt
■herself up as mistress of the house.
Taylor’s deeding his home to his wife
showed no premeditation. Guida burned
ths dssd and wrote to register of deeds
to “take the deed off She books "" She
also wrote a letter purporting to conn
from Mrs. Taylof, aa ng aha had gone
away.
Ths body was found in about a month
and later Mrs. diaries and Sabine ar>
rested. Practically all the neighbors
think Searles and Sabine had much
to do with the affair. Most of them
think Taylor should be out.
Prank W. Butler,^.who defended Tay
lor, advised him tp plead guilty of mur.
der. I think If a trial had been had
the truth would have been brought out
and he Would not have been convictsl
of more than manslaughter.
Mr. Ingraham claimed in closing
that Marshall Taylor did claim self
defense in many letters and state
ments and that Guida Searles was
responsible for his wife's death. Ths
opposition to a pardon seem to fear
Tayjot becoming a public charge. He
has relatives In Massachusetts
where he will go find will not become
such a public charge. I ask careful
consideration of the case and even
a conditional pardon would be ac
ceptable.
George C. Wing, Jr., of Auburn ap
peared for Fred Elliott, who was
sentenced to six months in Auburn
Jail for larceny of 130 from Frank
Mlllory of Bowdolnham, for whom
he worked. He claimed 'Mlllory owed
him 215 for work. The claim was that
the sentence was excessive and that
he has been sufficiently punished.

Water Plants for Your Window*.
Any time till the end of Deoember we
plant the Chinese Saored Lilies and
Narcissi In water. Por growing tbem
we nee large gla·· bowls eight inobes in
diameter. There are bowls provided
especially ornamented in original Ghlneae
hieroglyphics, nod tbeee are pretty as
well ns ornamental.
Three or fonr bulbe of the Chinese
Lily are pat Into eaoh, supported by
plaoing pebbles about the bulb·, and the
bowl la filled two-thirds full of water
and set in a sunny window In a oool
room free from draughts. As growth
proceeds, the roots work their wny
among the pebbles, matting together,
and this holds tbe bulbs as securely as
If tbey grew in tbe ground.
If your room is too warm, the bulbs
will grow too fast and the stalks will be
weak and spindling, not able to hold up
the flower beads, which will also be
small.
The olean light and dark brown· of
tbe roots showing through tbe glass of
tbe bowl oontrast delightfully with tbe
riob, fresh green of the stalks as devel
opment goes on.
All Chinamen in this country grow
their native lily, for with them it is the
good-luck plant, and when It grows well,
as it always does, becomes a good omen,
for it means that luok will be with tbem
throughout tbe year. These Celestials
literally ""love-up"" these plants, and 10
they bloom well for tbem, and so tbey
will for you if you provide tbe few ncoes
saries already mentioned.
The bulbs that you oau buy at your
florist's will yield large, white flowers
with a yellow center, deliciously fra
grant, some six or seven weeks frogs
planting; so if you put some into water,
at once, you will be delighted with
bloom in January and February, when
flower* are at a premium. And if you
continue planting every week for a few
weeks, you can prolong your water
blooming plants'nearly till Easter.
A bowl of these flowers will perfume
the whole atmosphere of a room with
tbe most bewitching odors, giving an air
of culture and refinement to the simplest
arrangements.
The Narclsal.
The Narcissus or Yellow Daffodil grew
first Id southern Prance and alone; the
bank: of the Mediterranean Sea. It was
then carried over to England and then
over here to ns. It used to be the cus
tom to plant them on All-Hallows, and
if the bulbs were well developed by St.
Barbara's Day, December 4, there would
be flowers by Christmas, and this was a
token of a fruitful New Tear.
These Sowers appear in great bnnohes,
often ten, eighteen and more flowers on
one stalk. The bulbs do not throw out
as many stalks as those of the Chinese
Sacred Lily, but there are many more
flowers to a stalk.
The flowers are white in color, only
more so than those of the Chinese Saored
Lily, and have a double yellow center.
They are deliriously fragrant. Planting
at once and at short intervals for a few
weeks will provide you flowers for a
long time in the New Tear.
There is no simpler way to grow plants
than to grow them In water, and we
would not like to have a season pass
without these beautiful water plants in
our home. We have no hothouse or
aoy special room for plants, but grow
them in the family living-room where
we can see them and enjoy them all the
time.
We bave fonr large windows to the
south, and one to the east, and It is In
these south windows where the water
planta luxuriate, along with the other
planta.
The windows come within four Inohes
of the floor and are high in proportion.
A shelf a little below the window-sills is
the place where the plants stand. Thus
they get plenty of sunshine and light, do
not shut out our view, and always
thrive.
If your room is too warm, I can only
promise you spindling plants, small
flowers and short-lived at that.

Whenever I see a pretty candlestick I
have a sudden longing to possess It, and
I have learned that I am not alone in
this longing. Many a woman baa felt
ibe fascination of tbe oandleetiok. Elec
tric lights are wonderful, and we would
not do without them; nevertheless, we
love the soft glow of candlelight. Per
haps it is a part of onr inheritance from
tbe paet.
Mother, I remember, used to keep a
candle in every room In the bouse.
Sometimes, when, at an inopportune
moment, I have been left alone in tbe
dark because tbe electric light took a
notion to ""go out,"" I have wished tbat
my mother's habit still prevailed.
But ic those ""good old days of old""
candlesticks were not expensive items.
Not always. In tbe frontier homes they
were apt to be as rustic as was tbe house
itself and all the furnishings. Tbe can
dlesticks were not of brass or other
metal, carefully made to be banded down
to posterity. Ours was—well, mother
made them herself. Thus:
A bit of board about an Inch tbiok, or
more, of the size of a book, oorners
rounded with a knife—(bis Is tbe founda
tion. In the center of the blook, mother
would draw a triangle to fit neatly over
a candle circle. At each angle of tbe
triangle a nail was driven into the blook,
just far enough to bold firm, and a
oandle inserted between the nails. Often
times a little knob was fastened at one
oorner of the wooden blook to serve as a
handle for the most rustlô of candle
stioks.
Remembering my mother's oandle·
sticks, not long ago I made a very dainty
""consolation"" gift along similar lines.
It was made like mother's oandlesticks,
only smaller, and carried a tag: ""To
light your way."" I selected a little pine
block, smoothed it with sandpaper, rub
bed it with powdered pumace stone wet
with water (linseed oil might be used)
till it was as smooth as glass. Holding
my candle in tbe center, I drew a oirole,
which guided me in tbe placing of three
beadleaa nails. At one corner of my
block I screwed into place, standing up
right, a large screw eye to be used as a
handle. Then I silvered tbe entire can
dleatick with aluminum paint. Indeed,
it waa a pretty little thing. Among my
gueats, it was something of a novelty,
and attracted more attention than the
larger prises.
A month later tbe girl who drew the
""oonsolation candlestick"" Invited us to
her home. To our delight she bad made
another us· for tbe oandleetiok idea, for
at eaob of our places atood a little home
made candlestlok (patterned after mine), ·
painted in ivory enamel, and holding up I
Its bit of light; and after the luncheon,
eaob of us carefully oarried home onr
dainty oandlestiok. We'll always re
member tbatInnoheon!
In fact, tbe Idea spread farther. One
of our number (a bride) has made a
oandlestiok for eaoh and every room In
her pretty new bungalow, and deoorated
eaoh oandleetiok to match the furnish
ings of tbe room.—It doesn't matter if
tbe eieotrlc lights do ""go out."" Be
hold!—a oandleetiok.
How to Make a New Fudge.
Marsbmallow fudge Is delicious. Tu
make it, boll two dupe of sugar with one
oup of milk or oream. Then add ooooa,
or one-fourth bar of chooolate. After
this mixture has boiled, put In butter,—
about three tablespoonfuls. When the i
oandy is done, add one-half teaspoonful
of vanilla or pineapple extraot. t
On the buttered plate, plaoe marsh· \
mallows at small Intervals apart, so that *
there will be a marsbmallow to eaob
square of tbe fudge. Then pour the *
1 oandy over the marsbmallows, and allow r
to oool. When It baa hardened some- 1
what, out into squares. f
Cinnamon-Drop Apple·.
Seleot a good, medlum-slaed, green .
apple (aa Pippin), wash, and core. Fill £
oeater with red oinnamon oaadles, or ι
uae part sugar and park oinnamon dropa. L
Bake until apples oraok open. Baste
the oenter of the apple with the red ι
ajrup which will form in the bottom ol \
the pan.

Printing Is said to hâve been intro
duced to the world Aug. 14,1437. John
Gutenberg stands at the head of the
early typogrnpliers, supported by the
genius of Schoeffer and the generous
patronage of Faust. Gutenberg used
only blocks^ and to Schoeffer is due
the movable type cast from matrices.
Caxton, who introduced the art into
England, began life as a trader, but
learned printing at Cologne. ^The first
printed book on record is ""The Psal
ter,"" which John Faust and Schoeffer
published at Metz in 1437.
Snow and Fireflies.
The oriental is always and ever pic
turesque. The student of the East
does not ""burn the midnight oil."" He
works by snow and fireflies. There is
an ancient legend about a Chinese stu
dent who was too poor to buy oil. So
In the summer months he studied all
night by the light of fireflies caught
and Imprisoned in a paper lantern, and
In the winter by the reflection of the
snow.—Gertrude Emerson In World

Willing to Help the Needy.
A famous woman teacher, eighty
years old, was sitting on the veranda
of a college dormitory in her wheel
chair. A student had just brought her
some ice water in her silver mug and
the teacher had finished drinking It
when some tourists came up, saw her
sitting there holding out her cup, find
they dropped a half dollar in it. Imag
ine their feelings when they discovered
who the ""beggar"" was !
The Industrious Bee.
The bee has two distinct stomachs.
In the first It stores away the honey
from the flowers until such time as it
Is ready to yield It up, while the other
stomach Is used simply and 'solely
for digestion purposes. When the bee
Is ready to deposit the honey It con
tracts the muscles of the stomach and
the honey Is ejected through the
mouth.

In your head
any Medicine
In treating a headache, there is one safe rule to follow:—Never use
containing acetanilid or similar coal-tar derivatives without the ad
vice of your physician. They may give temporary relief, but they
almost never reach the cause of the trouble and are likely to weaken
the heart. The most common form of headache, frequently called
sick headache, arising from a disordered stomach, may be avoided
by care in the choice of food. Shun pastry, candy and rich food,
take time to eat, chew your food thoroughly and keep your bowels
in good condition by using one-half to one teaspoonful of ""L. F.""
Atwood's Medicine after each meal. This old reliable remedy has
been a perfect blessing to thousands for sixty years. Get a bottle
to-day, and prove it for yourself. Any dealer has it for fifty cents,
or we mail a free sample on request. ""L. F."" Medicine Co., Portland,

The Old Tobacco Box
There was an old Geezer and he
had a wooden leg.
No tobacco could he borrow; no
tobacco could he beg.
There was another old Geezer who
took care of his rocks.
He always had tobacco in his old
tobacco box.
Said Geezer number one; “Won’t
you give me a smoke?”
Said the other old Geezer: “You've
no cause to be broke.
""If you'd buy a few Thrift Stamps
and save up your dough.
""Y'our store of tobacco wouldn't
always run low.”
Now this same old Geezer with the
same old wooden limb.
Is saving up in Thrift Stamps and
you can’t stump him.
He’s learned to be thrifty and
cares for his rocks
And has plenty of tobacco in his
old tobacco box.
All that you can spare, all that you
can give, should be exchanged for
Thrift Stamps.
THRIFT FABLES
The Noily Frog._
Once upon a time there was a Con
ceited Frog who was greatly in lov
with his own voice. He rivaled tin
Tom Cats in making the nights hide
ous and thought he was some pump
kins. But while he was busy croak
ing, the pool dried up, and he had n
place to go.
Moral—Making a loud noise over
what you have done won't get you
anywhere. Keep on buying War Sav
ings Stamps.
Turn all trash into Thrift Stamps.
TO BE A FAILURE,
Believe that everything is right
that you are not caught at
Be careless of responsibilities—
let George do it.
Fly into a passion on slight pre
text—lose your self-control.
Always think of GET, never
about GIVE.
Look gloomy; never see good in
other people.
Regard every' man who differs
from you as a knocker.
Never indulge in self-analysis.

Despite H. C. L.
Few N. E. People
Seek Alms Houses
The poorhouse business is growing
poorer. With thousands of people clam
oring about the high cost of living,
the fact comes to light that the total
number of persons admitted to the
charitable institutions of New Eng
land during the last six months is
less than it has been for that same
period in many years.
Less Poor In U. S.
Reports from the other districts
throughout the country show that the
poor-houses in all the states are feel
ing the same falling off in business.
Scarcity of labor, high prices paid
to shilled and unskilled workmen,
prohibition, and the cultivation of un
precedented habits of thriftiness
among the American people, are said
to be responsible for the principal de
crease in the number of inmates reg
istered in the various poor-houses
and other charitable institutions
throughout the country.
Thousands of people in New Eng
land have invested their savings in
Thrift Stamps, War Savings Stamps,
Treasury Saving Certificates and
other Government securities, which in
a large measure accounts for the
financial independence of the people,
as shown by the decreasing number
of admissions to the country's poor
houaes.
Hundreds Practice Thrift.
Mrs. F. U Higginson, director of
savings for the First Federal Re
serve District, states that there is a
greater number of people in New
England practicing thrift now than
before the war. However, she states
that there is still a large number of
people in these states, who as yet
have not learned the benefits to be
derived from Thrift and the proper
investment of their savings in safe
securities, rather than in untried in
vestments.
COMMON CENTS JINGLES.
Jingle Coin! Jingle Coin!
Jingle all the day.
You shan't be spent
For I am bent
To save the Thrift Stamp way.
Sing a song of War savings
Buy Thrift Stamps every day.
A dollar saved a dollar earned,
Buy often! It will pay
ADD T TO THE
PROVERBIAL “RV
A “T” has been added to the
three proverbial “R’s,” made
famous by the little old red
schoolhouse on the hill. It stands
for “Thrift.” The National Edu
cational Association, represent
ing the great bulk of the school
teachers and officials of this
country, have adopted thrift as
'a basic principle in \merican
education, and the teachers have
urged that thrift and savings be
tnade compulsory in every school
curriculum
in resolutions adopted at their ses
sion in Milwaukee, the members of
the National Educational Association
state that they are hearily in accord
with the present Government Savings
movement, and that all teachers
throughout the country will co-operate
in all ways possible in stimulating the
sale of Thrift and War Savings
Stamps. The teachers have also vol
unteered to do all in their power to
propagate the ideas of thrift.
WARNS PUBLIC AGAINST
WAR STAMP “SHARKS”
Warning against “loan sharks,”
who are “circulating false re
ports that the Treasury Depart
ment had abandoned its thrift
campaign,” has been issued by
Mrs. F. L. Higginson, director
of savings for the First Federal
Reserve District, yesterday.
""Unscrupulous interests to promote
the sale of their own securities are
sending broadcast in New England
information which states th»r the de
partment has abandoned the cam
paign,” she said.
""The Treasury Department has no
intention of discontinuing the thrft
campaign in this country. Recently
Secretary Glass said the sale of these
Government securities would go on
indefinitely.
""Today the Government realizes
| that if the high coet of living is to
be reduced the people must be taught
thrift.""
Go through your home room by

Decimating.
Originally, decimation was a mili
tary punishment of the Romans, who
dealt with large bodies of rebels, pris
oners or mutinous soldiers by execut
ing one man in ten. In popular use
todny. declination means the destruc
tion of n large proportion of anythin?;
as, “the epidemic has decimated the
population,” or “the Prussian guards
were decimated at Verdun.""
“Parsec"" Is a Long, Long Way.
A ""parsec"" is a distance that the
most zealous pedestrian would hardly
care to walk before breakfast. In
fact, it doesn't enter Into the sphere
of human operations at all, but it is
a handy unit In astronomy. It is
equal to 20,000.000,000,000 miles and
Is the distance traveled by light in
3.3 years. A few of the nearest stars
are from one to five parsecs distant
from us, but most of the stars that
dot the sky are scores or hundreds
of parsecs away.

“Sa what signifies wishing and
haping for battar times? We make
tkeea times battar if we bestir our
selves.""—®. Franklin.
Imagination, Wise and Otherwise.
What a wonderful gift is a wise
imagination! Occasionally an un
v.-ise imagination has ao many bril
liant qualities one is compelled to
wonder while it functions, but the
results excite no great amount of ad
miration among those with normal
minds. We suspect that is the fate
in store for the brilliant imagination
of one A. C. Townley, the ""big
noise” 6f the Non Partisan League,
formerly of North Dakota but now
with a toe-hold In 12 states and still
climbing.
As for the imagination of the
North Dakota farmers, tjiat was what
one should expect of a hardworking,
ihrifty people who had made an up
hill struggle from the time their feet
touched the soil of North Dakota.
They knew their lot was filled with
hard conditions, some of which they
were convinced didn't belong there,
an idea that in the main was prob
ably right. Their imagination had
not been developed by varied ex
perience, it had been warped by in
justice.
Then came Townley. When, where
or how he had WTestled with his im
agination doesn't matter here. He
had tried to be a flax king and failed.
Ha than became a social i t. He bad
his imagination in prime working or
der and from what lie already haa
accomplished with it we may infer
that be had been with it to the top
of a high mountain, had looked down
on millions toiling like ants under
his direction, saw’ harvests sown and
reaped—for him and his chosen; saw
banks, newspapers, graneries, ware
houses, all responding to bis dicta
tion, saw something more than
wealth massed where be might con
trol. saw power, and yet more power.
Lenine must possess a similar im
agination, most have been with it
tq a high place and seen a like vi
sion.
The North Dakota fanner's vision
was rather the product of Townley’s
than of his own imagination, the
vision of a hypnotic; so that all he
S£W was brotherly love prevailing
among the farmers of North Dakota,
each a proud individual possessor of
Ills farm and joint owner of banks,
the press, the grain elevators and
the merchandizing, from all of which
the streams of affluence should be his
10 share equally with his neighbors.
The scope of his imagination was
indeed narrow, or he would have
seen that if joint ownership of all
else but land should prove success
ful then joint ownership of the land
must follow; that instead of he hav
ing special advantage, none would
have it, save Townley, into whose
hands must pass absolute control.
Tou recall the camel’s head thrust
in the tent was quickly followed by
the carnal. Now the camel had noth
ing on Townley. That individual is
the uncrowned despot of North Da
kota and some think in a fair way
to become the overlord of Minnesota.
In. that state he is preaching indi
vidual ownership of land and joint
ownership dt all else—when talking
io farmers, but when hypnotizing!
the laborers lie talks of joint owner
ship of the land. And why not? Vic
tims of a trance are seldom skepti
Ah! but it is working finely for
Townley—for the present. The mem
bership dues alone are n golden
•stream and Townley knows whither it
Hows; the others seem not to have
guessed as yet. He gets them paid
up two years in advance; what imag
ination! Three millions to spend and
no questions asked. Taxes have ris
en two, three-fold and and in some
instances have quadrupled; but the
newspapers are edited by Townley
and there is the court—and who made
the judges, if you please?
The attorney general, the secre
tary of state and the state auditor
are fighting Townley and hie co
worker, Frazier, but the Townley leg
islature has passed laws snch, it is
said, that the attorney general can’t
successfully prosecute, as he had
done, a Townley bank president for
having allowed the institution to loan
hundreds of thousands of dollars on
collateral like post-dated checks of
farmers. But the fight is yet on.
’Hie To^iley crowd are in similar
I'light to the bolsheviki; they must
stfck fresh pastures for new kin# to i
milk as the home supply is insuffi
cient.
They arc headed toward Maine. It is
said they tried to start the cult here
a while ago and it fizzled. You also
recall what was said about the re
cent rounding up of the “reds,” that
none were found in Maine.
. It has been said of men with a
wise imagination—some call it far
sight and others insight—that “they
are from Missouri.”
It is more appropriate to, say:
“They are from Maine.” Not that
there is no injustice here; nor that
the farmers are always able to get
what they earn; not that they believe
it wrong to organize and adopt meth
ods for exacting better treatment, oh,
no! But down here we are inclined
to be skeptical of the wizard who
never succeeded in his own affairs;
we expect others to get fair profits,
capitalist and industrialist as well as
fanner, and we recognize that we
are all in the same boat, and it’s only
the ninny-naught who rocks the
boat.
Moreover, and some more, the men
of Maine are not neutral toward the
red flag; whereas the Non Partisan
League is.
Isn’t that “enough said""?
Benjamin Franklin and National
Thrift.
Benjamin Franklin inherited some
thing which moth, nor capitalist, nor
labor union, nor ""goat” getter could
appropriate, and not much else ex
cept a good physique. In other
words he was well born—according to
the American standard. Moreover
he waa thrifty. The promoters of
""Thrift Week” do well to recognize
the author and publisher of Poor
Richard’s Almanac as a great ex
ponent of thrift and common sense;
they could do no less.
Although he was born 214 years
ago vanity, pomp and extravagance
were on earth at the time; also ""close
time” on John Barleycorn had not
yet appeared in a vision to the
prophets. Franklin had plenty of op
portunity to rid himself of the bur
den of his printer’s wage; but as was
to be conclusively demonstrated
Franklin not only had brains, but
common sense as well.
He messed around quite a little
with European royalty but it didn't
seem to bother him or them that
""Primp'em & Pluck’em’s” label was
not to be found on his wearing ap
parel. ‘Leisure is timo for do
ing something useful” was the
way he expressed it. He lived
up to his text and became one of the
most useful as well as most dis
tinguished of American citizens, at
home and abroad. But wc presume
most of the squanderers of big money
today never heard of him, or if they
have, memory fails to recall. Never
mind, he will continue to be known
long after the big money has changed
hands several times.
The Celebrations
Two kinds of celebrations took
place throughout the land last night,
but both were occasioned by the
same event, the inauguration of na
tional prohibition.
The loudest and longest were the
ceremonies in the big hotels of New
York where the last grand fling was
done up in a style that eclipsed any
and all previous efforts at convivial
ity. The one aim of the revellers
seemed to be consume as much
liquid as possible before the lid
went on. There appeared to be;
plenty of such refreshment on tap,
provided one had the price. With!
most of the celebrants money was
no object: they were willing to pay ^
$20 a bottle for champagne, or $30
if necessary’, and highballs at $2 did
not go begging. Seventy-five cents
was not thought too much for a
straight whiskey of small propor-!
tions. Officials proved remarkably
deficient in detection of ""package
parades,” and the lid was merrily off
for the .last; time.
The other celebrations took place
in the churches where prayers of re

SUFFERED SINCE
CHILDHOOD
With Chronic Constipation and
Hoadaehos, Complstoly Raliovod
by “FRUIT-A-TIVES""
0TI8 M. BRYANT
49 Anderson St., Portland, Maine.
""I was troubled with Constipation
ever since I can remember; as a
result, was subject to distressing
Headaches and pain in my left side.
I would go tor two or three days
without any movement of the bowels.
I chanced to read about Truit
a-tives,’ in one of our local papers,
and began their use about four
months ago. Since then, I have been
free from Headaches, my bowels have
been regular, and from the use of
several boxes of ‘Fruit-a-tives,’ I
feel that the great benefit I have de
rived justifies me in pronouncing
them a remedy of true and excep
tional merit.”

joicing were offered and services of
thanksgiving were held for the com
ing of the victory after, the long,
hard fight. Chimes at midnight
were rung to sound the new dry era
and the dawn of a better and
brighter moral day.
While the fight has in one sense
been won, in another and greater
sense it is just beginning. It is one
thing to declare the country dry and
quite another to make and keep it
so. Since the dawn of history drunk
enness has been a human disgrace
and the root of many sins. Slowly
and often unwillingly, man has been
growing away from his natural or
acquired evil tendencies, and while
the mass of genuine sentiment is in
the line of moral righteousness,
many and many individuals cannot
or will not unless forced by law give
up the habits they have formed.
The natural stubbornness of the hu
man animal is another factor that
makes the task of the enforcement
officers anything but a sinecure and
a bed of roses.
Real prohibition that actually pro

As well as love for me.
It was my son of tender years.
Who gave his life for all;
He answered when the summons came.
To save the Country's fall.
The years that melt away in space,
Are lonely years to me—

Thou, God, who gavest me a while,
A boy to cheer my life,

While he prepared for strife;

Who doeth all things right.
And thank Thee for that child of mine,
That dwells with Thee tonight!

STAIRS SEEMED

Thi* Massachusetts Woman W«
So Weak and Nervous She Had
To Rest Frequently
Many people, otherwise in appar
ently good health, find themselves
“out of breath” after slight exertion.
To them it seems a long journey to
reach the top of a flight of stairs for
they must rest frequently. The
breathless condition, when accom
panied by pallor of the face and lips,
is a characteristic symptom of
anemia and is caused by the lack of
red corpuscles in the blood.
When the blood lacks red corpus
cles it is a scientific fact that a course
of treatment with Or. Williams' Pink
Pills will cause them to Increase.
This can be proved by a microscopic
examination or anyone can detect
the difference by looking in a mir
ror, for an increase in red corpuscles
shows quickly in the cheeks, and es
pecially in the lining membranes of
the eyelida
Mrs. Edith Foulds, No. 4 Brown’s
Court, North Andover, Mass., suffered
for three years from anemia. She
says: “The doctor said I didn’t make
blood fast enough. I was greatly re
duced in flesh and had no appetite:
I was so weak and exhausted that I
could hardly walk. My limbs ached
continually and I could not go up
stairs without sitting down to rest
before I reached the top. I was nerv
ous and had fluttering of the heart
and smothering spells.
“A friend who lived next door had
used Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills with
success for a poor condition of the
blood and I decided to try them.'
After I had taken three boxes I could
feel a decided benefit. I continued
the treatment and the pills built me i
up in health and strength. 1 have
recommended Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills to others and know them to be a
fine tonic.”
When a girl’s color fades, when her
cheeks and lips grow pale and she
gets short of breath easily and h°r
heart palpitates after slight exertion
or under the least excitement, it
means that she is suffering from thin
blood. Headache and backache often
accompany this condition and nerv
ousness is frequently present.
The remedy, of course, is to build
up the blood and for this purpose Dr
Williams’ Pink Pills are recommend
ed. They are I he remedy best suited
| to restore the blood, bring brightness
! to the eyes and put color in the
j cheeks and lips.

Blood,"" will be sent free by the Dr.

Editor’s Letter Box
A Communication
January I6tli, 1802.
Editor Kennebec Journal:
Mr. Jordan, in his address before
i tlle assessors, as reported in todays
! Journal, gives a very erroneous im
pression concerning the city valua
| tion of the Edwarcls Manufacturing
Co., while in the same address argu
. ing that valuation should be based
on selling value.
Mr. Jordan called on the city treas
urer and made inquiries concerning
the valuation. He asked if he want
ed the grand total, and he replied
that he only wanted the “mill prop
| erty and the improvements,"" and he
t takes these figures as the basis from
j which to draw his criticism, and
which his hearers had a right to in
fer covered the entire valuation.
| The fact is, however, that they
i cover about two-thirds because in
addition to these figures of *46p,000
for biUldings, dam, etc., and the *381,r
000 for improvements, a total of *841,
000 as reported by him we add for
other real estate *141,550 and for
“stock in trade” *225,000. a final total
valuation of *1.207,550.00 instrad of
the *841,000, quoted by Mr. Jordan.
And if Mr. Jordan’s ""selling value”
had been taken as a basis of valua
tion. this city and State would have
been sorry losers. Because everybody
knows that for years, prior to one
year ago, the Edwards Co. had paid
no dividends, had piled up a large
floating debt, and its stock was prac
tically unsalable, at any price. The
value of a manufacturing plant that
is not earning its taxes would not be
very high, if selling value alone were
to be considered.
It has been, under these circum
stances. a combination of necessity
on the,part of the city, and of will
ingness on the part of the company,
that enabled the city to maintain such
a valuation as it did keep up, through
all those struggling years.
I am writing you this letter in the
hope that it may fall under the eyes
of the gentlemen who listened to Mr.
Jordan's thoughtful address, ana
may remove from their minds any
false Impression which he may ljave
unwittingly conveyed as to th»
amount of our valuation or the judg
ment or integrity of our assessors.
Very respectfully,
BURLEIGH MARTIN,
Mayor.

(Continued from Page One)
coholic liquors, foreseeing no oppor
tunity for sale in this country, have
endeavored to rush the surplus to
other countries. Lack of shipping
space prevented more than a frac
tion being exported. Cuba and the
Bahamas have received most of what
was sent abroad. There were 70,
000,000 gallons on hand when war
time prohibition went into effect.
The amount exported is not ktnown
but is probably less than 20,000,000
gallons.
Attacks on constitutional prohibi
tion, began in several states, appar
ently are not viewed with alarm by
the reform forces. After the Su
preme Court upheld the constitution
ality of war-time prohibition and
the measures to enforce it, Wayne
B. Wheeler, general counsel of the
Anti-Saloon League of America, an
nounced that the only question left
on which the wets could make a
fight was whether prohibition was a
proper subject for constitutional ac
tion and whether the amendment
had been adopted legally. He con
tended there was t\,o doubt on the
subject. New Jersey officials, who
searched State Department records
of the ratification of the amendment,
announced they had found no varia
tions in language which would war
rant attacking it.
Enforcement of constitutional pro
hibition was lodged by Congress with
the Bureau of Internal Revenue,
which for years has been in close
touch with distilling and brewing in
terests in the collection of excise
taxes and active in running down
""moonshiners. ’ Evidence collected
by the bureau will be used in prose
cutions by the Department of Jus
tice.
Commissioner Roper has estab
lished an entirely separate division
in the Bureau of Internal Revenue
for the enforcement of prohibition,
headed by John F. Kramer of Mans
field, Ohio, as prohibition commis
sioner for the United States. He
will have under him nine federal
supervisors in charge of as many
districts, a director In each state and
a mobile force which can be shifted
from place to place as conditions de
mand.
Mr. Roper has made plain, how
ever, that enforcement of prohibition
depends largely on local sentiment
and has appealed to citizens of the i
United States to give their co-opera
tion to upholding the law of the coun
try. Federal forces, he said, would
be used to reinforce local efforts, and
where any state officer failed in his
duty, his constituents would be In
formed.
Approximately $500,000,000 in taxes
has been collected annually on alco
holic beverages, which now will have
to be obtained by the government i*i
some other way.
Prohibition sentiment, culminating
in the epoch-making amendment to
the constitution, has been growing
steadily in this country since 1808,
according to records compiled by the
board of temperance of the Methodist
Episcopal church. At that time, a
demand for moderation in the use of
ardent spirits arose, followed ten
years later by an even broader move
ment for abstinence from ardent
spirits and for moderation in the use
of malt liquors. This in turn gave
way. in 1840, to sentiment for abstin
ence from all alcoholic beverages.
Agitation for abolition of the prac
tice of licensing the sale of liquors I
did not come until 1847, resulting four
years later in the enactment of prohi
bition laws in Maine, the first state
to put prohibition into effect. Kan

sas was second in 1880 and North Da ■
kota third in 1889. Meanwhile, the
movement had grown to such propor- i
tion* that a National Prohibition
party was formed at a convention in i
Chicago, September 1, 1S69.
Women, always in the forefront of
tlie activity to stop the sale of alco- ,
holic drinks, organized for a con- i
certed fight after the famous Worn- :
en’s Crusade, 1873-4. Their associa
tion was later to become known
throughout the world by the name of •
the Women’s Christian Temperance |
Union, with a little white ribbon.
Another powerful influence in the i
fight for prohibition came into exist- ;
once in 1893 in the formation of the i
Anti-Saloon league. It is noteworthy ,
that both these organizations ha l !
their inception in Ohio. •
The modern wave of prohibition
legislation began with Georgia in
1907. Since that time, the movement
gained strength more rapidly than
any other reform in the history of I
the world, so that 33 states already j
have prohibition by state action, in ;
21 apodted by popular vote and in the !
others by legislative measures. At
the time the constitutional amend
ment was submitted, 24 of the 4S j
states and considerably more than
half of the territorial United States,
had prohibition. In states where pro- •
hibition was not state-wide,- it had ,
been adopted under local option laws ■
by many communities.
In addition to state laws, there !
have been In effect stringent meas- ,
ures adopted by Congress as aids •
toward winning the war, which gave
a tremendous impetus to the prohibi
tion movement. Studying the exam
ples of foreign countries, a law wa3 !
passed making it unlawful to provide ■
any man in uniform with alcoholic
beverages. Making of beer and whis
key was stopped under the food con- ;
trol act and the sale of drinks was !
terminated at midnight, last June 30. ’’
Shipment of liquor Into any states ‘
was prohibited by the bone-dry law. j
The constitutional amendment
was Anally adopted by Congress on
December 18, 1917, with a restric- j
live clause, hitherto unknown in j
legislative procedure, that It would1
he Inoperative unless ratified within
seven years. It required only 13.,
months. The vote in the House was -
281 to 128 and in the Senate 65 to
20.
Submission of the amendment to -
the States came at a time when ,
many legislatures were assembling

county last year. 15. BucHsport alone
reporting live of these, while that
town has lost one nonagenarian since
the beginning of the new year.

HANCOCK HALL.
Mayor Hagerthy Appeals to People
for Its Protection.
Five years ago a petition signed
by fifty prominent business men was
presented to the mayor and board
of aldermen requesting that Fred E.
Cooke be appointed manager and
custodian of Hancock hall. The
mayor and aldermen unanimously
agreed that Mr. Cooke should be ap
pointed.
Mr. Cooke found the hall In bad
condition, but under his manage
ment, with the help of the Ellsworth
dramatic club under Mr. Cooke’s di
rection, a new lighting system was
installed in dressing-rooms and on
the stage, and new carpets and fur
niture bought, without any expense
to the city, and the hall made a
place where Ellsworth citizens were
proud to come and bring their
friends.
At that time the ladies had com
plained of the lack of a dressing
room in the hall, as the regular
dressing-room was monopolized by
young men smoking. To give ttje
ladies a room to be used exclusively
by them and still have a place for
the men to smoke, a large, airy
room was arranged on the second
floor back of the gallery, and notices
were posted in the hall to that ef
fect.
Mr. Cooke has more than lived up
to his agreement with the city, and
has put much extra time in getting
the hall to look as it does.
Until two years ago it had been
the custom to use Hancock hall for
basket-ball games. Owing to the
fact that considerable damage was
done to the hall, such as breaking
doors and mirrors, tampering with
the lights, etc., it was decided at
that time that the playing of bas
ket-ball be discontinued in the hall.
This year, as an athletic club had
been formed, with prominent busi
I ness men as its officers, and a strong
basket-ball team put In the field, it
was deemed best to let the hall
again for basket-ball. The officers
of the club agreed to s#e that the
hall was properly used, and that no
damage was done.
Within the last two weeks, before
the basket-ball team began the use
of the hall, one of the toilet-rooms
which it was necessary to close on
account of a freeze-up, was broken
into, the fittings broken, and the
walls written upon. The coverings
have also been torn from the doors
in the upper halls.
Now, if the hoys or young men
who do these things will only real
ize that their parents are the ones
who, in the end. pay for the dam
age, perhaps they would be more
careful. It would seem, after the
efforts that Mr. Cooke has put forth
to give us a hall surpassed by no
city of its size in the*State, that we
should all be interested in keeping
it in its present condition, for Han
cock halls means to Ellsworth what
the city hall means to Bangor or
Portland.
Owing to a heavy war tax and the
increase in the cost of fuel, etc., it
now becomes necessary to advance
the rates for the hall. In the fu
ture. the rental of the hall will be
$12 per night for one entertain
ment. If followed by a dance,
special terms can be arranged with
■ Mr. Cooke, who is fully eutthorlzed
to make such terms.
This applies to all societies, clubs
or other organizations. All engage
ments of the hall may be made
through Mr. Cooke.

Gray Copper.
The work of a Swiss Investigator
suggests that absolutely pure copper
may have a light-gray color like that
of most other metals, since it is found
that copper which has been ten times
distilled In vucuo has only a pale rose
color, while the yellow color of golu
becomes much lighter under similar
treatment.

OBITUARY.
MRS? ABBIE S. ROBINSON.
Ellsworth lost one of Its most es
teemed elderly women In the death
last Friday morning of Mrs. Abbie
S. Robinson, widow of Edward F.
Robinson, sr. .The end came quiet- j
ly, after months of gradually fall
ing health.
Mrs. Robinson was born in
Brooksville December 23, 1843, a
daughter of the late Erastus Red
man, but Ellsworth had been her
home since childhood, when her
father #vas elected sheriff of the
county, and the family moved to
Ellsworth.
In early womanhood she was mar
ried to Mr. Robinson, and this es
timable couple enjoyed a compan
ionship of more than fifty years.
Mr. Robinson’s sudden death on
June 24. 1917, was a severe shock
to Mrs. Robinson. ,
Mrs. Robinson was a member of
the Congregational church, an.l for
years was one of the most active
workers of the society. She was a
woman of noble character, devoted
to lifer home and family.
She leaves three children—Mrs.
Charles S. Bragdon and Mrs. Thomas
P. Innes ofBrockton, Mass., and Ed
ward F. Robinson of Ellsworth. Of
her father’s family, two sisters and
a brotner survive—Mrs. Margaret
R. cole of Pawtucket, R. I., Mrs. !
Frances R. Keene of Providence, H. ;
I., and Erastus F. Redman of Dor- I
Chester, Mass. The two daughters
came to attend the funeral.
The funeral was held at the home
Sunday afternoon. Rev. R. B.
Mathews officiating. The bearers

CATARRH JES HARM
Whether It !• of the Nose, Throat,
or Other Organs, Get Rid of It.
Catarrh of the nose or throat when
It becomes chronic weakens the deli
cate lung tissues, deranges the diges
tive organs, and may lead to con
snmption. It impairs the taste, smell
and hearing, and affects the voice. It
is a constitutional disease and re
quires a constitutional remedy.
Take Hood’s Sarsaparilla, which
by purifying the blood removes the
cause of the disease and gives per
manent relief. This alterative and
tonic medicine has proved entirely
satisfactory to thousands of families
in three generations.
If there is biliousness or constipa
tion, take Hood’s Pills,—they are a
thorough cathartic, a gentle laxative.

true of tbe treatment of the after
effects. i
When tut influence germs tartar
the system all the disease-Sghtirg
forces of the Mood are mustered into
the service of expelling the invaders.
In mast lameis it is a hard tight at tlie j
c-nii of which the blood is left weak
and thm. Failure to adopt proper
methods of treatment during can
• alescence will mean, in many cases,
the deveiopment of neurasthenia, an
emia. neuralgia or rheumatism.
Among the very common after-ef
fects of the disease are headaches,
uizzy spelia. sleeplessness, depres
sion , indigestion and nervousness.
The biood needs a tonic.
Much misery may be avoided by
the method used by Mrs. Ho none us
J. Laoonture. of No. 76 Broad street,
.Marlbwo. Maas. When seen recently
at her home Mrs. Larontlire was
anxious that ethers aught profit by
her experience.
""Like so many others who had in
fluenza uuring the epidemic.'’ nays
Mrs. Laconture. ""I was left in a bad
ly run-down condition and it seemed
impossible for me to regain my
strength.

the disease was so sever? that i'
sapped almost all my strength. M
.stomach bothered me and foot
soured, causing severe pains and diz
zy spells. There was aiso a v ery
nipio heart action which caused me
to worry and I became discourugvt
I was ■'•ery weak and found great
difficulty in damg my housework.
""I read about Dr. Williams Pan
Pills -n a newspaper and decided to
give the remedy a trial. In a few
weeks there was a decided improve
ment m my condition. My appetite
was better and I could eat without
oistress. Gradually I regained my
strength and flhe unusual heart ac
,-tion was corrected. I feel better
than I have m a long time and car
strongly recommend Dr. Williams

The after-effects of influenza. ;i£ of

I flse disease itself. After tie fever ie
pone the blood is left weal: and

tonic treatment with Dr tvill nuns'

FEED THE BIRDS

Liatun id whai Curator Tbomaa A.

me bird lover, says oi tilt feathered
tnbee:
""The next few w«»ks will be the
mos: critical period oi the ■winter for

til the snow lea wee the ground. Pur
tig the early winter months there
hare been many places in the wood
and along the hedge rows where
weed seeds, insects, cocoons, etc.,
could be found, but since the recent
I fa.,1 of snow those placet am aJ:
dosed for some weeds aT least and
we find many tnorr birds m the
cities now than at any time during
the water.
""Eerc are a few suggestions: Hang
out suet or doughnuts on your cloth-r
red for the chickadee. creeper, etc.;
scatter hay chaff and fine grains for
the see.d eaters; but most important
of all, look after the cat. as the bird;
becoming tame by the kindnesses
shown them, fall easy prey t0 their
worst enemy, the domestic cat.

Kennabac Farm Bureau Notes.
The Sidney branch of the Kenne
bec county farm bureau will hold an
a!! uay meeting Thursday ul this
week n the Grange hall. Part at the
program will include proper live
stock feeding processes. Lane and
fertiliser will also be some of the
da Vs topics. Pmner is served at
noon an* a successful tune is being
anticipated. The Kennebec county
Farm Bureau bos received orders for
two car loads of seed potatoes. One
order comes from a bureau tr. Mas
sachusetts and one from Connecti
cut. The Bay State bureau h»»
previously received seed potatoes
from tins locality. They seem to
prefer Kennebec conntv tubers in
preference to those '-oming from the
northern part of the State. The or- !
ders have been received but not yet I

Here are two Baldwin apple trees in the same
orchard. The fruit of one tastes and is different
from that of the other, although they are both
Baldwins.
The same is true of coffee. There are not only
many kinds of coffee, but there are many types of
man? kinds.
Thousands of our customers wonder why La Tou
raine Coffee never vanes in goodness; why the
qualify has always the same rich, full flavor, the
same coffee satisfaction hidden in every cap of it
It is because La Touraine Coffee is selected coffee.
It is made from selected beans of particular types of
coffee grown on certain plantations noted for the
quality of the coflee beans they grow.
This requires a coffee skill so intuitive in opera
tion that yen of experience and a vast knowledge
of coflee lore are the necessary qualifications for
the selection of fee correct beans that will meet
the standard required by the La Touraine formula.
To have coffee-goodness upon your table, ask your

There can be no doubt that ths
situation regarding the spread of
Influenza throughout the country is
ono of grave concern. Itisquite true
that the number of cases does not
constitutean opidemicsuch as caused
tho suffering and sorrow during the
terrible days of 1918. Yet there is
no disguising the fact that everyone
should be on their guard against the
disease.
In one city alone, from January
20th to February 21st, three thousand,
one hundred and twenty-two cases of
Influenza and 139 deaths from tho
disease were reported to the Health
Department.
If the outbreak had come at the
beginning of the winter instead of
the end, we might reasonably feel
that the very cold weather would
check the spread of the disease. But
coming as it has, at the end of the
winter, there is grave fear that an
epidemic may occur. _ For spring,
with its slush and rain under foot,
its dampness and chill, its constant
changing from cold to warm and
back again, is a prolific source of
coughs and colds, pleurisy and
pneumonia. . '

1 SUMMER BEAUTY HINT |
Hair is by far the most conspicu
ous thing about us and is probably
the most easily damaged by bad or
careless treatment. If we are very
careful in hair washing, we will
have virtually no hair troubles. An
especially fine shampoo for this
Weather, one that brings out all the
natural beauty of the, hair, that dis
solves and entirely removes all
dandruff, excess oil and dirt, can
easily be used at trifling expense by
simply dissolving a teaspoonful of
canthrox (which you can get at any
druggist's), in a cup of hot water.
This makes a full cup of shampoo
liquid, enough so it is easy to apply
it to all the hair instead of just the
top of the head. This chemically
dissolves all impurities and creates a
soothing, cooling lather. Rinsing
leaves the scalp spotlessly clean, soft
and pliant, while the hair take$ on
the glossy richness of natural color,
also a fluffiness which makes it seem
much heavier than it is. After can
throx shampoo, arranging the.hair is
a pleasure.—Adv.

Still Owner’s Pig
Alibi Fails, Bound
Over to Sept. Term
As the result of the raid made by
deputy sheriffs on Mill street and
Mt. Vernon avenue .on Saturday
evening, Peter Lapierre and Adel
ard Aubert were arraigned before
Judge Robert A. Cony at the Augus
ta municipal court on Monday
morning, charged with manufactur
ing liquor and maintaining a liquor
nuisance. Burleigh Martin or
Augusta appeared as counsel for
both respondents. Lapierre waived
the reading of the warrant and ex
amination and pleaded not guilty,
and furnished bonds in the sum or
$1000 for his appparance at the Sep
tember term of the Kennebec county
superior court.
Testimony was offered in the case
against Aubert, who resides at 76
Mt. Vernon avenue. County Attor
ney Walter M. Sanborn appeared
for the State. At the conclusion or
tthe hearing Judge Cony found
probable cause and ordered the re
spondent to furnish bonds in the
sum of $500 for his appearance at
the Kennebec superior court in
September.
Deputy Sheriffs L. T. Dutton,
Marshall Pomerleau of Augusta and
A. G. Robinson of Gardiner, who
with Deputies H. H. McCauslana
and Fred Gross made the raid on
Saturday night, testified to calling
at Aubert’s residence and finding
what they claimed to be evidence or
a still. They testified that they
smelt fumes of liquor in the house,
and that they had found corn and
other grains. In the cellar they dis
covered two stoves and boilers. The
windows of the cellar, according to
their testimony, were closed up
with sawdust and the cellar en
trance was a trap door. Deputy
Sheriff Robinson testified that he
had been in that vicinity before and
had smelled liquor.
The respondent, Aubert, testified
that his reason for having stoves in
the basement of his house was that
it was there that he cooked food for
a pig that he kept, and that he did
the cooking there because his wife
complained of the odor when the
food was prepared in the living
rooms of the house. He stated that
he had two stoves because one of
them burned too much wood, and
he therefore used the second one.
The grains seized by the deputies, he
said, composed the main part of the
food he cooked for the pig. He said
that the reason he had the windows
closed in as they were, was because
boys had broken other windows in
that vicinity and he used that means
of protecting his windows.
Attorney Martin in his argument
for the defense pointed out that
there was no evidence of any sale,
that there was no evidence as to any
certain per cent of alcohol In the al
leged liquor, and that the testimony
of the respondent that this grain
was food for his pig was satisfac
tory evidence that he was not guilty.
County Attorney Sanborn argued
that the explanation made by the
Tea and Coffee
are Harmful
, to children, and
frequently disturb
ing to crown-ups.

Development of the Modern Bakery
Not many years ago bakery products were scorned by effi
cient housewives as unwholesome and unpalatable. The
wife that bought bakery products was talked about by her
neighbors for being too lazy or incapable to do her own bak
ing. The husband who was fed on. bakery products was
deeply pitied. Today thousands of housewives, without
fear of exciting neighborhood gossip depend upon the bak
ery for their family’s bread, doughnuts and cake. Today
thousands of husbands eat bakery food without exciting a
single pity. ' -
This change of attitude is due to one
thing—the development of the bak
ing industry. In the old days bakery
products were usually inferior; cheap
ingredients were used, mixing, bak
ing and handling was done in a care
less, unsanitary way. But gradual
ly bakers everywhere came to realize
that public patronage could be se
cured only by making their products
as wholesome and palatable as those
made at home. Because of that
realization has been developed the
modern system of baking—use of
purest and best ingredients obtain
able, use of scientific machinery in
mixing and baking, employment of
expert bakers, and a careful main
taining of sanitary conditions in
making and handling^ bakery prod
ucts.

Today bakers all over the United
States are subscribing to a million
dollar fund for the American Insti
tute of Baking to carry on the scien
tific development of the baking indus
try and to give the public the best
bakery products possible.
The bakers of Augusta and Hallowell
are modern bakers; you should ap
preciate the products they make and
the service they give. And when you
buy bakery products be sure they
were made at home—don’t accept
products made by outside firms un
less you wish to hurt home industries
and home interests. “Buy Home
Products* first.

respondent, Aubert, was ridiculous,

the window being plugged up, the
fumes of the liquor, and the grain
seized were all evidence of the re
spondent’s guilt.
TAX BILLS
ARE ALL OUT
From the office of City Treasurer
Wilson Monday cqmes the news that
all the tax bills, resident and non-resi
dent, are in the mail, having left the
office. This is the first time for years
that the bills have been completed
and sent out as early. Last year the
bills were not sent out until the 10th
and 11th of July.
The tax rate of Augusta is 19
mills. The poll tax is $2, the same as
in former years. An increase of 500
poll taxes is noted over that of last
year. This is due to the return of the
men in military servUje. During 1917,
1918 and 1919 the men in the service
wero exempt thorn paying the poll tax
■ ■■■» ■■...■HumMlllimHIHIIIIIHHIIIimimHIHmUUmmililUl
unless they so desired. They are pay
ing under the 1920 taxes as the law
does not exempt them.
The assessed valuation of Augusta
property is much lower in market
value than quite a number of olties
In the State do put their valuation.
All this is interesting to the tax
payer. who is at all times interested to
learn what citizens of other places are
paying.

seated. The play is one of those rare
stories that are fascinating to rich
and poor alike. It is somewhat
melodramatic and yet retains a fine
ness which brings out ifiany light
comedy points as well as heart-throbs
for all.
George Allan England drew his
characters from the two extremes of
life, the rich and the poor. His princi
pal character is the son of a wealthy
man who, in seeking knowledge of the
world, is thrown in close contact not
only with the poorest of poor but with
the lower type of criminals. And in
this atmosphere he meets the young
woman who later becomes his wife.
But how he wins her, how he defeats
the pride of his rich-but-once-poor
parents, and how he assists in the
reformation of the lives of several
helpless creatures, gives the story
that uncommon twist which places it
far above the level of the average.
In this Republic release some of
the screen's most capable players are
shown in leading parts. Such play
ers as Lon Chaney, Seena Owen, Mel
bourne MacDowell, Bernard Durning.
Jack Curtis, and many others of equal
prominence add to the attractiveness
of the production.
Good hearty laughs will be pro
vided by ""Off His Trolley.” a Century
comedy that is said to be full of sur
prises. The Universal Screen Maga
zine will have something new to offer
while the Kinograms will be more In
teresting than ever.—Adv.

: Augusta has been talking about the

: Levcne has never been better than he .
j is this year and Frank Murray ""Joe P. \

STEAMER SERVICE
Boston-Kennebec Line
Discussed
May Be Resumed by Company Sup*
ported by Publically Interested
People—Plans Uncertain
Splendid news comes from dow-n
river—in the report that definite
steps are being taken in sounding1
the public as to support for organ
izing a company to take over the ;
Boston-Kennebec steamboat service
and re-establishing a steamer serv- ‘
ice between the Hub and Kennebec
points, as in days of old, before the |
war absolutely disrupted that means
of communication.
It has not yet been decided just
what will be attempted in the way of
steamer serx'ice, whether a new
company will do business with the
Eastern Steamship Co., and acquire 1
some of its remaining property for
the purpose or whether a new com
pany will operate—but it is certain
that the merchants, the manufactur
ers. the traveling and the general
public of the Kennebec valley and
the sections which it serves as a
feeder of communication will wel- 1
come any means of water service
between Gardiner and Boston. Said
a prominent Augusta business man
Thursday:
‘ Saying nothing against the rail
roads. for they are doubtless doing
all they can under the circumstances
and so far as they are permitted
w ith the burdens they themselves are
bearing, it is a fact that a steam
boat service between our river
points and Boston would be a bless- 1
ing. It is. therefore, not strange
that the people wherever approached
arc giving support to the Idea of
forming a company for the purpose
mentioned.""

Concrete Steamer Polias
Will Be Left on the Legde
Rockland. .Me.. Nov. 7.—Attempts to
float the concrete steamship Polias,
which went ashore on Old Cylley
Ledge near Port Clyde Feb. 6. have
been abandoned and the gear which
was assembled by Charles Ludlow of
New York for that purpose is being
removed front the stranded hull.
Still on even keel, and apparently
afloat, the big craft which cost the
government nearly $1,000,000 will
probably spend her last days on the
ledge which she struck during the
stormy February night after straying
far from her course.
No trace has ever been found of the
12 men who were lost when they left
the craft in a lifeboat. The Polias
had just delivered her third cargo at
Stockton Springs.
One reason why no further attempt
Will probably be made to float the
craft, it is said, is because the gov
ernment is unable to handle to advan
tagre its ships of this type.

HARTLAND MAN
AMONG MISSING
Hart land, Nov. 5—Up' to Friday
noon, no trace had been found of
Carroll Richardson, aged al>out 2r»,
and a well known resident of this""
village who has been missing since
Wednesday noon. There arc -vary
ing theories as to his whereabouts.
Some think that he may have been
drowned and the authorities arc
making preparations to search the
pond. Others arc of the opinion
that he may have wandered away
and will yet be found alive. Much
agitation has been occasioned by his
mysterious disappearance as he was
highly esteemed here and has many
friends. He has a wife and two
small children.
Mr. Richardson left home Wednes
day morning after breakfast and was
last seen in the village about 11 A.
M. that morning. He was employed
in the woolen mill and during the
shutdown was cutting his winter's
wood in a lot about a mile out. He
left his home presumably to work
there. When he did not return at
night a searching party was organ
ized and looked for him nearly all
night. His tools were found at the
wood lot where he had left them.
He was in his -working clothes and
had no money with him as far as
known.
His home has been ~ happy, his
habits excellent and his friends are
utterly at a. loss to account for his
whereabouts. He is of slim build,
nearly six feet in height, blue eyes
and medium complexion and wore
his working clothes. Search was
continued Thursday with no clues.
The Portland Police
Think Brown Crazy
(Portland Express)
The local police are of the opinion
that the Jcdin Brown arrested last
night by Sheriff John A. Moores of
Somerset county in connection with
the brutal murder of Asa B. Er.lrekin,
the station agent at the Embden sta
tion of the Maine Central Railroad,
was in this City Tuesday night.
A John Brown who gave his address
as I.ancaster. Pa., sought lodging at
the local police station on Tuesday
evening. He stated on the lodging
book that he was a Negro. The John
Brown arrested at North Anson in
connection with the murder was a
mulatto. The age of both men che:k
up. When he appeared at the local
police station the man who gave his
name as Brown did not wear a coat
He explained he had lost it. He was
said to be about 5 feet. 10 inches tall,
and of rather slight build. The jani
tor of the police station said that ha
judged from his conversation that he
was a Boston man. He left here Wed
nesday morning.
Search of the lodging book failed io
reveal the names of the other two mod
arrested in connection with the mur
der. It is the opinion of the local au
thorities that if it is the same man. lie

tion of the State when he left her?.
Seine Breaks and.
the Salmon Escape
The netting of the Sebago salmon
from the pool at the Raymond hatchery
on Friday was witnessed by nearly a
hundred spectators. While there were
doubtless as many fish in the pool as
last year, the operators were handi
capped by the breaking of the -seine
with its heavy load of struggling fish,
resulting in many of them getting
free, and the men were forced to sweep
the pool three times, while last year
one sweep yielded a thousand fish.
The four sweeps brought to the dip
nets about 900 .salmon, lusty, writhing
fish of a noticeably larger size than
any in preceding years. It is estimated
by a representative of tho local fish
and game association that the largest
falmon would weigh at least 12 pounds,
and hundreds that were not less than
eight and nine. There seems to be an
absence of the Anal 1 sizes—two to four
pounds—and it was estimated that the
average weight would be near seven
pounds. Next week the pool will be
swept again, and, it is believed that
there will be more breeding salmon at
the hatchery than ever before.
At White’s bridge and Crooker river
there are as many more salmon seek
ing the natural spawning beds.—Press.
New Haven. Nov. «—In one of the
hardest fought battles seen in the
Yale Bowl this season the unbeated
Brown eleven went down to defeat
before the Yale Bulldog, 14 to 10. The
teams were so evenly matched that
It was not until the last quarter that
Tad Jones’ substitute team was able
to keep the ball in the visitors' ter
ritory. The game was marked by the
sensational runs by Ogden. Brown’s
star quarterback, who again and
again ran through the Yale team for
long gains and was only prevented
from reaching Eli's goal by Murphy's
excellent tackling. The Brunonians
also thrilled the spectators by swift
lateral passes and formations by
which the’ ends, Williams and A I- I
bright, carried the ball. I
French Ambassador
Back in U.S. Nov. 24 to
! Patch Up League •
i Washington, .Nov. 7—(By The As
sociated Press)—Jules Jusserand, the
French ambassador, ’who went home
several months ago on leave and who
later was assigned to special duty in
conectlon with the settlement of the
Polish question is to return to Wash
ington on November 24. He is ex
pected to bring with him the latest
, views of his government regarding
■ the recasting of the League of Na
tions covenant and to be prepared to
discuss the subject with the officials
of the Harding administration.
It has long been known in diplo
matic circles in Washington that the
I principal Allied powers were prepared
| to go far towards meeting any desire
; of the American government for
j changes in the plan of the covenant,
hut it has been stated in at least one
important quarter that such changes
| must in no caSh violate the underl.v
' ing principles of the convention.
; Diplomats generally do not believe
that such changes that such changes
'■ could be made by reservations such
as were proposed in the so-called1
Lodge plan.
In their opinion amendments
; would be necessary. They would re
quire the approval of the various
1 signatory powers..
Another matter that will engage
the attention of Ambassador Jusser
and ts the status of the commercial
; relations bqtween the United States
i and France under existing treaties.
; France last spring gave notice to all
: powers with which she had com
jnurcial treaties of the termination
S of these conventions: her purpose
I being to replace them with a com
i plete set of new treaties shaped to
1 r:cet the new conditions in trade and
I commerce resulting from the war.
j Be fore the denunciation took effect,
however, the French government
withdrew the notice so far as it con
! kerned the United States.
I France has not abandoned her
I plan . of revising her commercial
treaties and' is understood to be de
ferring the opening of negotiations
with the United States until .after the
| change of administrations in Wash
i ington on next March 4.

Democratic Move
to Reorganize Party
Washington. Nov. « — Another j
move toward reorganization of the
Democratic party was made here to- j
day when .Senator Harrison of
Mississippi, chairman of the speak- j
er’s bureau during the campaign is- !
sued a statement calling on his fel- '
low Democrats to “bury all past dif
ferences and forget the recent cam
paign.”
""The Democratic party is not!
dead.” he said, ""it has only received !
h temporary setback and will make'
itself felt every day of every session
of Congress until the next election
rolls around."" I
As to party reorganization, Mr.
Harrison said: ;
‘I believe that there should be a !
Change in the permanent organiza- !
tion of the Democratic party. 1 don't I
mean by that the Chairman George
White should not be retained as
chairman of the National commit
tee. He showed marked ability in
the management of the recent cam- i
paign which was waged against j
overwhelming odds. No one could ;
have done better than he did under !
the circumstances.”
FALLING PRICES
Department of Justice Satisfied Says
Howard Fipg
Washington. Nov. 0—Commodity
prices have indicated such a falling
off that the department of justice is !
""largely content to Idt the down- I
ward trend carry on by its own mo
mentum,"" according to a statement 1
tonight by Howard H’igg, special as- j
sistant in charge of the work -and •
who has resigned, effective Nqv. 15. J
“The deportment feels that Us'
sane policy of steady pressure is vin- 1
dicated b >the results achieved,” ^tr.

action will continue alonsr this line
to get business to readjust necessity,
but avoiding endangering the under
lying sound prosperity of the nation.”

fession in order that the supply might
more nearly equal the steadily in
creasing demand for community
nurses. It has devised a scheme of
i “public health centers” for the relief
of maladies and for instruction in
hygiene, dietetics, and general prin
ciples of disease-prevention. With
its nurses and nurses' aides it has
rendered incalculable service in the
serious epidemics of influenza. It
has carried instruction in hygiene
and first aid intd schools, the
women's clubs, and the homes of our
country. It has taught young and
j untaught mothers how to care in
; telligently for their babies, and has
done much in many ways to promote
| child welfare, upon which the wel
fare of the nation ultimately rests,
j It has made it a fundamental prin
ciple to avoid futile duplicatibns. to
cooperate with public agencies when
its cooperation was sought, and to
supply deficiencies where such agen
cies had not yet been established.
“It has continued its educational
work among the school children
through its Junior Red Cross branch,
and it has. as one result of its war
experience, put preparation* for dis
aster-relief on a scientific foundation,
so that it is now equipped to meet
disaster emergencies promptly in al
most every part of our country.
""By systematic plans and practical
performances, it has given a clear
answer to the question why»the Red
Cross should be continued and car
ried over from war activity into
peace-time activity. The answer is
in the record.
""Additional to these obvious as
pects of the matter, there is another
reason why I. as President of the
I'nited States and President of the
American Red Cross, urfee my fellow
countrymen to join the Red Cross in
impressive numbers: Reaction fol
lows emotion, and after great effort
comes perilous lassitude. Sound
patriotism and genuine human ser
vice are continuous, not intermittent,
not contingent merely upon the ex
citement of war. If there is in some
of us an inward cooling of the fine
fervor which animated us in the crisis
of the nation's stress and peril, a con
traction of the spirit which ennobled
us as individuals and as a nation,
now, (luring the 'Red Cross Roll Call,
is a fitting season to take counsel
with our inner selves, to rekindle the
old flame, to reaffirm allegiance to
practical patriotism and practical
humanitarianism. and to symbolize
the regeneration of our better
thoughts and handsomer selves by
re-enlistment in a great army mobil
ized for the common good.""

TREASURY HEADS
(Continued from Page One)
ditions in business as a result of aft
er-the-war transition and readjust
ment.
Mr. Houston's view of this was said
to be that tax receipts would .be ma
terially lower later in the present
fiscal year and that therefore, the
government income under the present
revenue laws could not be taken as
a basis for calculating future receipts.
The Treasury will insist strongly on
legislation which would produce four
billions for the next year, but the
ways and means of getting it will be
left to Congress, except for the sug
gestion contained in the Treasury's
report. In fact, the,tax law framers
would lx» informed that there is no
alternative to voting a revenue act
that will produce the required
amount.
The program for handling the na
tional debt—and its payment is ob
ligatory—can be accomplished only
through annual revenue of four bil
lion dollars. Treasury officials said.
With the Victory notes maturing in
1923 and the War Saving securities
falling due in the interim, and until
1921, it was declared a possibility
that the four billion dollar tax level
might have to be continued even un
til the latter date.
Treasury views are expected to
clash with those of the Republican
majority in Congress on the questions
of ways and means of obtaining the
needed revenues. But with the
changing administration, it was un
derstood, the present regime at the
Treasury would merely suggest and
offer little^argument in support of
their stand for repeal of the excess
profits taxes and replacement of the
amounts so gained by higher income
axes.
Meanwhile, the Treasury will carry
on its announced program of short
term financing, issuing certificates of
indebtedness to meet current require
ments in anticipation of quarterly
payment of income and profit taxes.
It was said that the certificate issues
probably would continue on a bi
monthly basis until Congress indi
cates what it will do in the way of
lax legislation.

Point Isabel, where the party is to

tion today as to whether he might use :
hiB twelve days' stay to gather first

aboard* the train that any steps he

character.
It has been reported that efforts •
would be made to arrange a confer- !
ence between Mr. Harding and Gen- !
eral Obregon. the president-elect of'
Mexico and informal overtures also I
ere expected from the Antl-Obregon I
faction, but Mr. Harding has indicat
ed that In the Interests of strict pro-'*
priety he would not encourage any i
consultation with those who are not!
citieens of the United States. On the
other hand it Is pointed out that'
should General Obregon actually pre- !
